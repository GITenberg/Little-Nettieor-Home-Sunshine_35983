</div>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/i007a.jpg" width="90" alt="D" title="" />
</div><div class="noindent">own in a little hollow, with the sides
grown full of wild thorn, alder bushes, and
stunted cedars, ran the stream of a clear spring. It
ran over a bed of pebbly stones, showing every
one, as if there had been no water there, so clear
it was; and it ran with a sweet soft murmur or
gurgle over the stones, as if singing to itself and
the bushes as it ran.</div>

<p>On one side of the little stream a worn footpath
took its course among the bushes; and down this
path, one summer's afternoon, came a woman and
a girl. They had pails to fill at the spring: the
woman had a large wooden one and the girl a
light tin pail; and they drew the water with a
little tin dipper, for it was not deep enough to let
a pail be used for that. The pails were filled in
silence, only the spring always was singing; and
the woman and girl turned and went up the path
again. After getting up the bank, which was only
a few feet, the path still went gently rising through
a wild bit of ground, full of trees and low bushes;
and not far off, through the trees, there came a
gleam of bright light from the window of a house
on which the setting sun was shining. Half-way
to the house the girl and the woman stopped to
rest; for water is heavy, and the tin pail, which
was so light before it was filled, had made the
little girl's figure bend over to one side like a
willow branch all the way from the spring. They
stopped to rest, and even the woman had a very
weary, jaded look.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I shall give up some of these days,"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, mother!" the little girl answered,
cheerfully. She was panting, with her hand on
her side, and her face had a quiet, very sober look;
only at those words a little pleasant smile broke
over it.</p>

<p>"I shall," said the woman. "One can't stand
everything,&mdash;for ever."</p>

<p>The little girl had not got over panting yet,
but standing there, she struck up the sweet air
and words,&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" summary="poem">
<tr><td align="left">"'There is rest for the weary,</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;There is rest for the weary,</td></tr>

</table>
</div>

<p>"Yes, in the grave!" said the woman bitterly.
"There's no rest short of that&mdash;for mind or
body."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mother dear. 'For we which have
believed do enter into rest.' The Lord Jesus don't
make us wait."</p>

<p>"I believe you eat the Bible and sleep on
the Bible," said the woman, with a faint smile,
taking at the same time a corner of her apron to
wipe away a stray tear which had gathered in her
eye. "I am glad it rests you, Nettie."</p>

<p>"And you, mother."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," Mrs. Mathieson answered with
a sigh. "But there's your father going to bring
home a boarder, Nettie."</p>

<p>"A boarder, mother!&mdash;What for?"</p>

<p>"Heaven knows!&mdash;if it isn't to break my back
and my heart together. I thought I had enough
to manage before, but here's this man coming,
and I've got to get everything ready for him by
to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"Who is it, mother?"</p>

<p>"It's one of your father's friends; so it's no
good," said Mrs. Mathieson.</p>

<p>"But where can he sleep?" Nettie asked, after
a moment of thinking.</p>

<p>Her mother paused.</p>

<p>"There's no room but yours he can have.
Barry won't be moved."</p>

<p>"Where shall I sleep, mother?"</p>

<p>"There's no place but up in the attic. I'll see
what I can do to fit up a corner for you&mdash;if I ever
can get time," said Mrs. Mathieson, taking up
her pail. Nettie followed her example, and certainly
did not smile again till they reached the
house. They went round to the front door, because
the back door belonged to another family.
At the door, as they set down their pails again
before mounting the stairs, Nettie smiled at her
mother very placidly, and said,</p>

<p>"Don't you go to fit up the attic, mother; I'll
see to it in time. I can do it just as well."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson made no answer, but groaned
internally, and they went up the flight of steps
which led to their part of the house. The ground
floor was occupied by somebody else. A little
entry-way received the wooden pail of water, and
with the tin one Nettie went into the room used
by the family. It was her father and mother's
sleeping-room, their bed standing in one corner.
It was the kitchen apparently, for a small cooking-stove
was there, on which Nettie put the tea-kettle
when she had filled it. And it was the common
living-room also; for the next thing she did was
to open a cupboard and take out cups and saucers,
and arrange them on a leaf table which stood
toward one end of the room. The furniture was
wooden and plain; the woodwork of the windows
was unpainted; the cups and plates were of the
commonest kind; and the floor had no covering
but two strips of rag carpeting; nevertheless the
whole was tidy and very clean, showing constant
care. Mrs. Mathieson had sunk into a chair as
one who had no spirit to do anything, and watched
her little daughter setting the table with eyes
which seemed not to see her. They gazed inwardly
at something she was thinking of.</p>

<p>"Mother, what is there for supper?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing. I must make some porridge."
And Mrs. Mathieson got up from her
chair.</p>

<p>"Sit you still, mother, and I'll make it. I can."</p>

<p>"If both our backs are to be broken," said Mrs.
Mathieson, "I'd rather mine would break first."
And she went on with her preparations.</p>

<p>"But you don't like porridge," said Nettie.
"You didn't eat anything last night."</p>

<p>"That's nothing, child. I can bear an empty
stomach, if only my brain wasn't quite so full."</p>

<p>Nettie drew near the stove and looked on, a
little sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"I wish you had something you liked, mother!
If only I was a little older, wouldn't it be nice?
I could earn something then, and I would bring
you home things that you liked out of my own
money."</p>

<p>This was not said sorrowfully, but with a bright
gleam as of some fancied and pleasant possibility.
The gleam was so catching, Mrs. Mathieson turned
from her porridge-pot, which she was stirring, to
give a very heartfelt kiss to Nettie's lips; then she
stirred on, and the shadow came over her face
again.</p>

<p>"Dear," she said, "just go in Barry's room and
straighten it up a little before he comes in&mdash;will
you? I haven't had a minute to do it, all day;
and there won't be a bit of peace if he comes in
and it isn't in order."</p>

<p>Nettie turned and opened another door, which
let her into a small chamber used as somebody's
bed-room. It was all brown like the other, a strip
of the same carpet in the middle of the floor, and
a small cheap chest of drawers, and a table. The
bed had not been made up, and the tossed condition
of the bed-clothes spoke for the strength and
energy of the person that used them, whoever he
was. A pair of coarse shoes were in the middle
of the whole; another pair, or rather a pair of half-boots,
out at the toes, were in the middle of the
floor; stockings,&mdash;one under the bed and one
under the table. On the table was a heap of confusion;
and on the little bureau were to be seen
pieces of wood, half-cut and uncut, with shavings,
and the knife and saw that had made them. Old
newspapers, and school-books, and a slate, and
two kites, with no end of tails, were lying over
every part of the room that happened to be convenient;
also an ink-bottle and pens, with chalk
and resin and a medley of unimaginable things
beside, that only boys can collect together and
find delight in. If Nettie sighed as all this hurly-burly
met her eye, it was only an internal sigh.
She set about patiently bringing things to order.
First she made the bed, which it took all her
strength to do, for the coverlets were of a very
heavy and coarse manufacture of cotton and woollen
mixed, blue and white; and then gradually
she found a way to bestow the various articles in
Barry's apartment, so that things looked neat and
comfortable. But perhaps it was a little bit of a
sign of Nettie's feelings, that she began softly to
sing to herself,&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent">
  <span class="small">"'There is rest for the weary.'"</span>
 </p>
</div>

<p>"Hallo!" burst in a rude boy of some fifteen
years, opening the door from the entry,&mdash;"who's
puttin' my room to rights?"</p>

<p>A very gentle voice said, "I've done it, Barry."</p>

<p>"What have you done with that pine log?"</p>

<p>"Here it is,&mdash;in the corner behind the bureau."</p>

<p>"Don't you touch it, now, to take it for your
fire,&mdash;mind, Nettie! Where's my kite?"</p>

<p>"You won't have time to fly it now, Barry;
supper will be ready in two minutes."</p>

<p>"What have you got?"</p>

<p>"The same kind we had last night."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't care for supper." Barry was getting
the tail of his kite together.</p>

<p>"But please, Barry, come now; because it will
give mother so much more trouble if you don't.
She has the things to clear away after you're
done, you know."</p>

<p>"Trouble! so much talk about trouble! <i>I</i> don't
mind trouble. I don't want any supper, I tell
you."</p>

<p>Nettie knew well enough he would want it by-and-bye,
but there was no use in saying anything
more, and she said nothing. Barry got his kite together
and went off. Then came a heavier step on
the stairs, which she knew; and she hastily went
into the other room to see that all was ready. The
tea was made, and Mrs. Mathieson put the smoking
dish of porridge on the table, just as the door
opened and a man came in&mdash;a tall, burly, strong
man, with a face that would have been a good face
enough if its expression had been different and
if its hue had not been that of a purplish-red flush.
He came to the table and silently sat down as
he took a survey of what was on it.</p>

<p>"Give me a cup of tea! Have you got no
bread, Sophia?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but what you see. I hoped you
would bring home some money, Mr. Mathieson.
I have neither milk nor bread; it's a mercy there's
sugar. I don't know what you expect a lodger
to live on."</p>

<p>"Live on his board,&mdash;that'll give you enough.
But you want something to begin with. I'd go
out and get one or two things&mdash;but I'm so confoundedly
tired, I can't."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson, without a word, put on a shawl
and went to the closet for her bonnet.</p>

<p>"I'll go, mother! Let me go, please. I want
to go," exclaimed Nettie, eagerly. "I can get it.
What shall I get, father?"</p>

<p>Slowly and weariedly the mother laid off her
things; as quickly the child put hers on.</p>

<p>"What shall I get, father?"</p>

<p>"Well, you can go down the street to Jackson's,
and get what your mother wants: some milk and
bread; and then you'd better fetch seven pounds
of meal and a quart of treacle. And ask him to
give you a nice piece of pork out of his barrel."</p>

<p>"She can't bring all that!" exclaimed the
mother; "you'd better go yourself, Mr. Mathieson.
That would be a great deal more than the
child can carry, or I either."</p>

<p>"Then I'll go twice, mother: it isn't far; I'd
like to go. I'll get it. Please give me the
money, father."</p>

<p>He cursed and swore at her for answer. "Go
along, and do as you are bid, without all this
chaffering! Go to Jackson's, and tell him you
want the things, and I'll give him the money
to-morrow. He knows me."</p>

<p>Nettie knew he did, and stood her ground.</p>

<p>Her father was just enough in liquor to be a
little thick-headed and foolish.</p>

<p>"You know I can't go without the money,
father," she said, gently; "and to-morrow is
Sunday."</p>

<p>He cursed Sunday and swore again, but finally
put his hand in his pocket and threw some
money across the table to her. He was just in
a state not to be careful what he did, and he
threw her crown-pieces where, if he had been
quite himself, he would have given shillings.
Nettie took them without any remark, and her
basket, and went out.</p>

<p>It was just sundown. The village lay glittering
in the light that would be gone in a few
minutes; and up on the hill the white church,
standing high, showed all bright in the sun-beams,
from its sparkling vane at the top of the
spire down to the lowest step at the door. Nettie's
home was in a branch road, a few steps from
the main street of the village, that led up to the
church at one end of it. All along that street
the sunlight lay, on the grass, and the roadway,
and the side-walks, and the tops of a few elm
trees. The street was empty; it was most people's
supper-time. Nettie turned the corner and
went down the village. She went slowly: her
little feet were already tired with the work they
had done that day, and back and arms and
head all seemed tired too. But Nettie never
thought it hard that her mother did not go instead
of letting her go; she knew her mother
could not bear to be seen in the village in the
old shabby gown and shawl she wore; for Mrs.
Mathieson had seen better days. And besides
that, she would be busy enough as it was, and
till a late hour, this Saturday night. Nettie's
gown was shabby too&mdash;yes, very shabby, compared
with that almost every other child in the
village wore; yet somehow Nettie was not
ashamed. She did not think of it now, as her
slow steps took her down the village street; she
was thinking what she should do about the
money. Her father had given her two or three
times as much, she knew, as he meant her to
spend; he was a good workman, and had just got
in his week's wages. What should Nettie do?
Might she keep and give to her mother what was
over? it was, and would be, so much wanted! and
from her father they could never get it again. He
had his own ways of disposing of what he earned,
and very little indeed went to the wants of his
wife and daughter. What might Nettie do!
She pondered, swinging her basket in her hand,
till she reached a corner where the village street
turned off again, and where the store of Mr.
Jackson stood. There she found Barry bargaining
for some things he at least had money for.</p>

<p>"Oh, Barry, how good!" exclaimed Nettie;
"you can help me carry my things home."</p>

<p>"I'll know the reason first, though," answered
Barry. "What are you going to get?"</p>

<p>"Father wants a bag of corn-meal, and a piece
of pork, and some treacle; and you know I
can't carry them all, Barry. I've got to get bread
and milk besides."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" said Barry; "now we'll have fried
cakes! I'll tell you what I'll do, Nettie&mdash;I'll
take home the treacle, if you'll make me some
to-night for supper."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't, Barry! I've got so much else to
do, and it's Saturday night."</p>

<p>"Very good&mdash;get your things home yourself,
then."</p>

<p>Barry turned away, and Nettie made her bargains.
He still stood by, however, and watched
her. When the pork and the meal and the treacle
were bestowed in the basket, it was so heavy
she could not manage to carry it. How many
journeys to and fro would it cost her?</p>

<p>"Barry," she said, "you take this home for
me, and if mother says so, I'll make you the
cakes."</p>

<p>"Be quick, then," said her brother, shouldering
the basket, "for I'm getting hungry."</p>

<p>Nettie went a few steps farther on the main
road of the village, which was little besides one
long street, and not very long either, and went
in at the door of a very little dwelling, neat and
tidy like all the rest. It admitted her to the
tiniest morsel of a shop&mdash;at least there was a
long table there which seemed to do duty as a
counter; and before, not behind it, sat a spruce
little woman sewing. She jumped up as Nettie
entered. By the becoming smartness of her
calico dress and white collar, the beautiful order
of her hair, and a certain peculiarity of feature,
you might know before she spoke that the little
baker was a Frenchwoman. She spoke English
quite well, but rather slowly.</p>

<p>"I want two loaves of bread, Mrs. August, and
a pint of milk, if you please."</p>

<p>"How will you carry them, my child? you
cannot take them all at the time."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I can," said Nettie, cheerfully. "I
can manage. They are not heavy."</p>

<p>"No, I hope not," said the Frenchwoman; "it
is not heavy, my bread! but two loaves are not
one, no more. Is your mother well?"</p>

<p>She then set busily about wrapping the loaves
in paper and measuring out the milk. Nettie
answered, her mother was well.</p>

<p>"And you?" said the little woman, looking
at her sideways. "Somebody is tired this evening."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Nettie, brightly; "but I don't
mind. One must be tired sometimes. Thank
you, ma'am."</p>

<p>The woman had put the loaves and the milk
carefully in her arms and in her hands, so that
she could carry them, and looked after her as she
went up the street.</p>

<p>"One must be tired sometimes!" said she to
herself, with a turn of her capable little head. "I
should like to hear her say 'One must be rested
sometimes;' but I do not hear that."</p>

<p>So perhaps Nettie thought, as she went homeward.
It would have been very natural. Now
the sun was down, the bright gleam was off the
village; the soft shades of evening were gathering,
and lights twinkled in windows. Nettie
walked very slowly, her arms full of the bread.
Perhaps she wished her Saturday's work was all
done, like other people's. All I can tell you is,
that as she went along through the quiet deserted
street, all alone, she broke out softly singing
to herself the words,&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>and that when she got home she ran upstairs
quite briskly, and came in with a very placid
face, and told her mother she had had a pleasant
walk&mdash;which was perfectly true.</p>

<p>"God bless you, child!" said her mother; "you
are the very rose of my heart!"</p>

<p>There was only time for this little dialogue, for
which Mr. Mathieson's slumbers had given a
chance. But then Barry entered, and noisily
claimed Nettie's promise. And without a cloud
crossing her sweet brow, she made the cakes,
and baked them on the stove, and served Barry
until he had enough; nor ever said how weary
she was of being on her feet. There were more
cakes left, and Mrs. Mathieson saw to it that
Nettie sat down and ate them; and then sent
her off to bed, without suffering her to do anything
more; though Nettie pleaded to be allowed
to clear away the dishes. Mrs. Mathieson did
that, and then sat down to darns and patches on
various articles of clothing, till the old clock of
the church on the hill tolled out solemnly the
hour of twelve all over the village.</p>

</div><div class="noindent">ettie's room was the only room on
that floor besides her mother's and
Barry's. It was at the back of the house, with
a pleasant look-out over the trees and bushes
between it and the spring. Over these the view
went to distant hills and fields, that always
looked pretty in all sorts of lights, Nettie thought.
Besides that, it was a clean, neat little room;
bare, to be sure, without even Barry's strip of rag
carpet; but on a little black table lay Nettie's
Bible and Sunday-school books; and each window
had a chair; and a chest of drawers held all her
little wardrobe and a great deal of room to spare
besides; and the cot-bed in one corner was nicely
made up. It was a very comfortable-looking
room to Nettie.</div>

<p>"So this is the last night I shall sleep here!"
she thought as she went in. "To-morrow I must
go up to the attic. Well, I can pray there just
the same; and God will be with me there just
the same."</p>

<p>It was a comfort; but it was the only one
Nettie could think of in connection with her
removal. The attic was no room, but only a
little garret used as a lumber-place; not boarded
up nor plastered at all; nothing but the beams
and the side boarding for the walls, and nothing
but the rafters and the shingles between it and
the sky. Besides which, it was full of lumber of
one sort and another. How Nettie was to move
up there the next day, being Sunday, she could
not imagine; but she was so tired that as soon
as her head touched her pillow she fell asleep,
and forgot to think about it.</p>

<p>The next thing was the bright morning light
rousing her, and the joyful thought that it was
Sunday morning. A beautiful day it was. The
eastern light was shining over upon Nettie's
distant hills with all sorts of fresh, lovely colours,
and promise of what the coming hours would
bring. Nettie looked at them lovingly, for she
was very fond of them, and had a great many
thoughts about those hills. "As the mountains
are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round
about His people;"&mdash;that was one thing they
made her think of. She thought of it now as she
was dressing, and it gave her the feeling of being
surrounded with a mighty and strong protection
on every side. It made Nettie's heart curiously
glad, and her tongue speak joyful things; for
when she knelt down to pray she was full of
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>The next thing was that, taking her tin pail,
Nettie set off down to the spring to get water to
boil her kettle. It was so sweet and pleasant&mdash;no
other spring could supply nicer water. The
dew brushed from the bushes and grass as she
went by; and from every green thing there went
up a fresh dewy smell, that was reviving. The
breath of the summer wind, moving gently,
touched her cheek and fluttered her hair, and
said God had given a beautiful day to the world;
and Nettie thanked Him in her heart, and went
on rejoicing. Sunday was Nettie's holiday, and
Sunday school and church were her delight. And
though she went in all weathers, and nothing
would keep her, yet sunshine is sunshine, and she
felt so this morning. So she gaily filled her pail at
the spring and trudged back with it to the house.
The next thing was to tap at her mother's door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson opened it, in her night-gown;
she was just up, and looked as if her night's sleep
had been all too short for her.</p>

<p>"Why, Nettie! is it late?" she said, as Nettie
and the tin pail came in.</p>

<p>"No, mother; it's just good time. You get
dressed, and I'll make the fire ready. It's beautiful
out, mother!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson made no answer, and Nettie
went to work with the fire. It was an easy
matter to put in some paper and kindle the light
wood; and when the kettle was on, Nettie went
round the room, softly setting it to rights as well
as she could; then glanced at her father, still
sleeping.</p>

<p>"I can't set the table yet, mother."</p>

<p>"No, child; go off, and I'll see to the rest.&mdash;If
I can get folks up, at least," said Mrs. Mathieson,
somewhat despondingly.</p>

<p>Sunday morning that was a doubtful business,
she and Nettie knew. Nettie went to her own
room to carry out a plan she had. If she could
manage to get her things conveyed up to the
attic without her mother knowing it, just so much
labour and trouble would be spared her, and her
mother might have a better chance of some rest
that day. Little enough, with a lodger coming
that evening! To get her things up there,&mdash;that
was all Nettie would do to-day; but that
must be done. The steep stairs to the attic
went up from the entry-way, just outside of
Nettie's door. She went up the first time to see
what room there was to bestow anything.</p>

<p>The little garret was strewn all over with things
carelessly thrown in merely to get them out of
the way. There was a small shutter window in
each gable. One was open, just revealing the
utter confusion, but half showing the dust that
lay on everything. The other window, the back
one, was fairly shut up by a great heap of boxes
and barrels piled against it. In no part was
there a clear space or a hopeful opening. Nettie
stood aghast for some moments, not knowing
what to do. "But if I don't, mother will have
to do it," she thought. It nerved her little arm,
and one thought of her invisible Protector nerved
her heart, which had sunk at first coming up.
Softly she moved and began her operations, lest
her mother downstairs should hear and find out
what she was about before it was done. Sunday
too! But there was no help for it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the pile of boxes, she resolved
to begin at the end with the closed window; for
near the other there were things she could not
move: an old stove, a wheelbarrow, a box of heavy
iron tools, and some bags of charcoal, and other
matters. By a little pushing and coaxing, Nettie
made a place for the boxes, and then began her
task of removing them. One by one, painfully,
for some were unwieldy and some were weighty,
they travelled across in Nettie's arms, or were
shoved and turned over and across the floor, from
the window to a snug position under the eaves,
where she stowed them. Barry would have been
a good hand at this business, not to speak of his
father; but Nettie knew there was no help to
be expected from either of them, and the very
thought of them did not come into her head.
Mr. Mathieson, provided he worked at his trade,
thought the "women folks" might look after the
house; Barry considered that when he had got
through the heavy labours of school, he had done
his part of the world's work. So Nettie toiled
on with her boxes and barrels. They scratched
her arms; they covered her clean face with dust;
they tried her strength; but every effort saved
one to her mother, and Nettie never stopped
except to gather breath and rest.</p>

<p>The last thing of all under the window was a
great old chest. Nettie could not move it, and
she thought it might stay there very conveniently
for a seat. All the rest of the pile she cleared
away, and then opened the window. There was
no sash&mdash;nothing but a wooden shutter fastened
with a hook. Nettie threw it open. There, to
her great joy, behold, she had the very same
view of her hills, all shining in the sun now.
Only this window was higher than her old one
and lifted her up more above the tops of the
trees, and gave a better and clearer and wider
view of the distant open country she liked so
much. Nettie was greatly delighted, and refreshed
herself with a good look out and a breath
of fresh air before she began her labours again.
That gave the dust a little chance to settle too.</p>

<p>There was a good deal to do yet before she
could have a place clear for her bed, not to speak
of anything more. However, it was done at last,
the floor brushed up, all ready, and the top of
the chest wiped clean; and next Nettie set about
bringing all her things up the stairs and setting
them here, where she could. Her clothes, her
little bit of a looking-glass, her Bible and books
and slate, even her little washstand, she managed
to lug up to the attic, with many a journey and
much pains. But it was about done before her
mother called her to breakfast. The two lagging
members of the family had been roused at last,
and were seated at the table.</p>

<p>"Why, what have you been doing, child? how
you look!" said Mrs. Mathieson.</p>

<p>"How do I look?" said Nettie.</p>

<p>"Queer enough," said her father.</p>

<p>Nettie laughed, and hastened to another subject:
she knew if they got upon this there would
be some disagreeable words before it was over.
She had made up her mind what to do, and now
handed her father the money remaining from her
purchases.</p>

<p>"You gave me too much, father, last night,"
she said, simply; "here is the rest."</p>

<p>Mr. Mathieson took it and looked at it.</p>

<p>"Did I give you all this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>"Did you pay for what you got, besides?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He muttered something which was very like
an oath in his throat, and looked at his little
daughter, who was quietly eating her breakfast.
Something touched him unwontedly.</p>

<p>"You're an honest little girl," he said. "There!
you may have that for yourself." And he tossed
her a shilling.</p>

<p>You could see, by a little streak of pink colour
down each of Nettie's cheeks, that some great
thought of pleasure had started into her mind.
"For myself, father?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"All for yourself," said Mr. Mathieson, buttoning
up his money with a very satisfied air.</p>

<p>Nettie said no more, only ate her breakfast a
little quicker after that. It was time, too; for
the late hours of some of the family always made
her in a hurry about getting to Sunday school;
and the minute Nettie had done, she got her
bonnet&mdash;her Sunday bonnet&mdash;the best she had
to wear&mdash;and set off. Mrs. Mathieson never let
her wait for anything at home <i>that</i> morning.</p>

<p>This was Nettie's happy time. It never troubled
her that she had nothing but a sun-bonnet
of white muslin, nicely starched and ironed, while
almost all the other girls that came to the school
had little straw bonnets trimmed with blue and
pink, and yellow and green ribbons; and some of
them wore silk bonnets. Nettie did not even
think of it; she loved her Sunday lesson, and
her Bible, and her teacher, so much; and it was
such a pleasant time when she went to enjoy
them all together. It was only a little way she
had to go, for the road where Mrs. Mathieson
lived, after running down a little farther from
the village, met another road which turned right
up the hill to the church; or Nettie could take
the other way, to the main village street, and
straight up that. Generally she chose the forked
way, because it was the emptiest.</p>

<p>Nettie's class in the Sunday school was of ten
little girls about her own age; and their teacher
was a very pleasant and kind gentleman, named
Mr. Folke. Nettie loved him dearly; she would
do anything that Mr. Folke told her to do.
Their teacher was very apt to give the children
a question to answer from the Bible, for which
they had to look out texts during the week. This
week the question was, "Who are happy?" and
Nettie was very eager to know what answers the
other girls would bring. She was in good time,
and sat resting and watching the boys and girls
and teachers as they came in, before the school
began. She was first there of all her class; and
she watched so eagerly to see those who were
coming, that she did not know Mr. Folke was
near till he spoke to her. Nettie started and
turned.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said her teacher, kindly.
"Are you quite well, Nettie, this morning?"
For he thought she looked pale and tired. But
her face coloured with pleasure, and a smile
shone all over it, as she told him she was very
well.</p>

<p>"Have you found out who are the happy
people, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Folke; I have found a verse. But
I knew before."</p>

<p>"I thought you did. Who are they, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Those who love Jesus, sir."</p>

<p>"Ay. In the Christian armour, you know, the
feet are 'shod with the preparation of the Gospel
of peace.' With the love of Jesus in our hearts,
our feet can go over rough ways and hardly feel
that they are rough. Do you find it so?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir!"</p>

<p>He said no more, for others of the class now
came up; and Nettie wondered how he knew, or
if he knew, that she had a rough way to go over.
But his words were a help and comfort to her.
So was the whole lesson that day. The verses
about the happy people were beautiful. The
seven girls who sat on one side of Nettie repeated
the blessings told of in the fifth chapter of
St. Matthew, about the poor in spirit, the mourners,
the meek, those that hunger and thirst after
righteousness, the merciful, the pure in heart, and
the peacemakers. Then came Nettie's verse. It
was this:</p>

<p>"Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for
his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God."</p>

<p>The next girl gave the words of Jesus, "If ye
know these things, happy are ye if ye do them."</p>

<p>The last gave "Blessed is he whose transgression
is forgiven, whose sin is covered."</p>

<p>Then came Mr. Folke's verse, and Netty
thought it was the most beautiful of all.</p>

<p>"Blessed are they that do His commandments,
that they may have right to the tree of life, and
may enter in through the gates into the city."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Folke talked about that city&mdash;its
streets of gold, and the gates of pearl, through
which nothing that defileth can by any means
enter. He told how Jesus will make His people
happy there; how they will be with Him, and
all their tears wiped away. And Jesus will be
their Shepherd; His sheep will not wander from
Him any more; "and they shall see His face,
and His name shall be in their foreheads."</p>

<p>From school they went to church, of course.
A strange clergyman preached that day, and
Nettie could not understand him always; but
the words of the hymn and Mr. Folke's words
ran in her head then, and she was very happy
all church-time. And as she was walking home,
still the tune and the words ran in her ears,&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" summary="poem">
<tr><td align="left">"Jesus all the day long</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Is my joy and my song;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;O that all His salvation might see!"</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>So, thinking busily, Nettie got home and ran
upstairs. What a change! It looked like a
place very, very far from those gates of pearl.</p>

<p>Her mother sat on one side of the stove, not
dressed for church, and leaning her head on her
hand. Mr. Mathieson was on the other side,
talking and angry. Barry stood back, playing
ball by himself by throwing it up and catching
it again. The talk stopped at Nettie's entrance.
She threw off her bonnet and began to set the
table, hoping that would bring peace.</p>

<p>"Your father don't want any dinner," said
Mrs. Mathieson.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!" thundered her husband; "but I
tell you I'll not take anything now; so leave your
cooking till supper&mdash;when Lumber will be here.
Go on, child, and get your work done."</p>

<p>There were no preparations for dinner, and
Nettie was at a loss, and did not like to say
anything for fear of bringing on a storm. Her
mother looked both weary and out of temper.
The kettle was boiling, the only thing about the
room that had a pleasant seeming.</p>

<p>"Will you have a cup of tea, father?" said
Nettie.</p>

<p>"Anything you like&mdash;yes, a cup of tea will
do; and hark ye, child, I want a good stout
supper got this afternoon. Your mother don't
choose to hear me. Mr. Lumber is coming, and
I want a good supper to make him think he's
got to the right place. Do you hear, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>Nettie went on to do the best she could. She
warmed the remains of last night's porridge, and
gave it to Barry, with treacle, to keep him quiet.
Meanwhile she had made the tea, and toasted a
slice of bread very nicely, though with great
pains, for the fire wasn't good; and the toast
and a cup of tea she gave to her father. He ate
it with an eagerness which let Nettie know she
must make another slice as fast as possible.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Nettie&mdash;I say, give us some of that,
will you?" said Barry, finding his porridge poor
in taste.</p>

<p>"Barry, there isn't bread enough&mdash;I can't,"
whispered Nettie. "We've got to keep a loaf
for supper."</p>

<p>"Eat what you've got, or let it alone!" thundered
Mr. Mathieson, in the way he had when he
was out of patience, and which always tried
Nettie exceedingly.</p>

<p>"She's got more," said Barry. "She's toasting
two pieces this minute. I want one."</p>

<p>"I'll knock you over if you say another word,"
said his father.</p>

<p>Nettie was frightened, for she saw he meant
to have the whole, and she had destined a bit for
her mother. However, when she gave her father
his second slice, she ventured, and took the other
with a cup of tea to the forlorn figure on the
other side of the stove. Mrs. Mathieson took
only the tea. But Mr. Mathieson's ire was roused
afresh. Perhaps toast and tea didn't agree with
him.</p>

<p>"Have you got all ready for Mr. Lumber?"
he said, in a tone of voice very unwilling to be
pleased.</p>

<p>"No," said his wife,&mdash;"I have had no chance.
I have been cooking and clearing up all the
morning. His room isn't ready."</p>

<p>"Well, you had better get it ready pretty
quick. What's to do?"</p>

<p>"Everything's to do," said Mrs. Mathieson.</p>

<p>He swore at her. "Why can't you answer a
plain question? I say, <i>what's</i> to do?"</p>

<p>"There's all Nettie's things in the room at
present. They are all to move upstairs, and the
red bedstead to bring down."</p>

<p>"No, mother," said Nettie, gently, "all my
things are upstairs already; there's only the cot
and the bed, that I couldn't move."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson gave no outward sign of the
mixed feeling of pain and pleasure that shot
through her heart. Pleasure at her child's
thoughtful love, pain that she should have to
show it in such a way.</p>

<p>"When did you do it, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"This morning before breakfast, mother. It's
all ready, father, if you or Barry would take up
my cot and the bed, and bring down the other
bedstead. It's too heavy for me."</p>

<p>"That's what I call doing business and having
some spirit," said her father. "Not sitting and
letting your work come to you. Here, Nettie,
I'll do the rest for you."</p>

<p>Nettie ran with him to show him what was
wanted; and Mr. Mathieson's strong arms had
it all done very quickly. Nettie eagerly thanked
him; and then seeing him in good humour with
her, she ventured something more.</p>

<p>"Mother's very tired to-day, father," she whispered;
"she'll feel better by-and-bye if she has
a little rest. Do you think you would mind
helping me put up this bedstead?"</p>

<p>"Well, here goes!" returned Mr. Mathieson.
"Which piece belongs here, to begin with?"</p>

<p>Nettie did not know much better than he; but
putting not only her whole mind but also her
whole heart into it, she managed to find out and
to direct him successfully. Her part was hard
work: she had to stand holding up the heavy
end of the bedstead while her father fitted in the
long pieces; and then she helped him to lace
the cords, which had to be drawn very tight;
and precious time was running away fast, and
Nettie had had no dinner. But she stood patiently,
with a thought in her heart which kept
her in peace all the while. When it was done,
Mr. Mathieson went out, and Nettie returned to
her mother. She was sitting where she had left
her. Barry was gone.</p>

<p>"Mother, won't you have something to eat?"</p>

<p>"I can't eat, child. Have you had anything
yourself?"</p>

<p>Nettie had seized a remnant of her father's
toast, and was munching it hastily.</p>

<p>"Mother, won't you put on your gown and
come to church this afternoon? Do! It will
rest you. Do, mother!"</p>

<p>"You forget I've got to get supper, child.
Your father doesn't think it necessary that
anybody should rest, or go to church, or do anything
except work. What he is thinking of, I am sure
I don't know. There is no place to eat in but
this room, and he is going to bring a stranger
into it; and if I was dying I should have to
get up for every meal that is wanted. I never
thought I should come to live so! And I cannot
dress myself, or prepare the victuals, or have
a moment to myself, but I have the chance of
Mr. Lumber and your father in here to look on!
It is worse than a dog's life!"</p>

<p>It looked pretty bad, Nettie thought. She did
not know what to say. She began clearing away
the things on the table.</p>

<p>"And what sort of a man this Mr. Lumber is,
I don't know. I dare say he is like his name&mdash;one
of your father's cronies&mdash;a drinker and a
swearer. And Mr. Mathieson will bring him
here, to be on my hands! It will kill me before
spring, if it lasts."</p>

<p>"Couldn't there be a bed made somewhere
else for Barry, mother? and then we could eat
in there."</p>

<p>"Where would you make it? I could curtain
off a corner of this room, but Barry wouldn't
have it, nor your father; and they'd all want to
be close to the fire the minute the weather grows
the least bit cool. No; there is nothing for me
but to live on till Death calls for me!"</p>

<p>"Mother, Jesus said, 'He that liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Mrs. Mathieson, with a kind of
long-drawn groan, "I don't know how it will be
about that! I get so put about now in these
times, that it seems to me I don't know my own
soul!"</p>

<p>"Mother, come to church this afternoon."</p>

<p>"I can't, child. I've got to put up that man's
bed and make it."</p>

<p>"That is all done, mother, and the floor
brushed up. Do come!"</p>

<p>"Why, who put it up?"</p>

<p>"Father and I."</p>

<p>"Well! you do beat all, Nettie. But I can't,
child; I haven't time."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, plenty. There's all the hour of
Sunday school before church begins. Now do,
mother!"</p>

<p>"Well, you go off to school; and if I can,
maybe I will. You go right off, Nettie."</p>

<p>Nettie went, feeling weary and empty by dint
of hard work and a dinner of a small bit of dry
toast. But she thought little about that. She
wanted to ask Mr. Folke a question.</p>

<p>The lesson that afternoon was upon the peacemakers;
and Mr. Folke asked the children what
ways they knew of being a peacemaker. The
answer, somehow, was not very ready.</p>

<p>"Isn't it to stop people from quarrelling?" one
child asked.</p>

<p>"How can you do that, Jane?"</p>

<p>Jane seemed doubtful. "I could ask them to
stop," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, suppose you did. Would angry people
mind your asking?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. If they were very angry,
I suppose they wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. One thing is certain, Jane; you
must have peace in your own heart, to give you
the least chance."</p>

<p>"How, Mr. Folke?"</p>

<p>"If you want to put out a fire, you must not
stick into it something that will catch."</p>

<p>"That would make the fire worse," said one of
<ins title="lacking in original">the</ins> girls.</p>

<p>"Certainly. So if you want to touch quarrelsome
spirits with the least hope of softening
them, you must be so full of the love of Jesus
yourself that nothing but love can come out of
your own spirit. You see, it means a good deal
to be a peacemaker."</p>

<p>"I always thought that must be one of the
easiest things of the whole list," said one of the
class.</p>

<p>"You won't find it so, I think; or rather you
will find they are all parts of the same character,
and the blessing is one. But there are more
ways of being a peacemaker. What do you do
when the hinge of a door creaks?"</p>

<p>One said "She didn't know;" another said
"Nothing." "I stop my ears," said a third. Mr.
Folke laughed.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> would not do for a peacemaker," he
said. "Don't you know what makes machinery
work smoothly?"</p>

<p>"Oil!" cried Jane.</p>

<p>"Oil to be sure! One little drop of oil will
stop ever so much creaking and groaning and
complaining, of hinges and wheels and all sorts
of machines. Now, people's tempers are like
wheels and hinges. But what sort of oil shall
we use?"</p>

<p>The girls looked at each other, and then one
of them said, "Kindness."</p>

<p>"To be sure! A gentle word, a look of love,
a little bit of kindness, will smooth down a
roughened temper or a wry face, and soften a
hard piece of work, and make all go easily. And
so of reproving sinners. The Psalmist says, 'Let
the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness:
and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent
oil, which shall not break my head.' But, you
see, the peacemaker must be righteous himself,
or he hasn't the oil. Love is the oil&mdash;the 'love
of Jesus.'"</p>

<p>"Mr. Folke," said Nettie, timidly, "wasn't
Jesus a peacemaker?"</p>

<p>"The greatest that ever lived!" said Mr. Folke,
his eyes lighting up with pleasure at her
question. "He made all the peace there is in the
world, for He bought it, when He died on the
cross to reconcile man with God. All our drops
of oil were bought with drops of blood."</p>

<p>"And," said Nettie, hesitatingly, "Mr. Folke,
isn't that one way of being a peacemaker?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I mean, to persuade people to be at peace
with Him?"</p>

<p>"That is the way above all others, my child;
that is truly to be the 'children of God.' Jesus
came and preached peace; and that is what His
servants are doing, and will do, till He comes.
And 'they shall be called the children of God.'
'Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to
love one another.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Folke paused, with a face so full of thought,
of eagerness, and of love, that none of the children
spoke, and some of them wondered. And
before Mr. Folke spoke again, the superintendent's
little bell rang, and they all stood up to
sing. But Nettie Mathieson hardly could sing;
it seemed to her so glorious a thing to be <i>that</i>
sort of a peacemaker. Could she be one? But
the Lord blessed the peacemakers; then it must
be His will that all His children should be such;
then He would enable her to be one! It was a
great thought. Nettie's heart swelled with hope
and joy and prayer. She knew whose peace she
longed for first of all.</p>

<p>Her mother had now come to church, so Nettie
enjoyed all the services, with nothing to hinder.
Then they walked home together, not speaking
much to each other, but every step of the way
pleasant in the Sunday afternoon light, till they
got to their own door. Nettie knew what her
mother's sigh meant, as they mounted the stairs.
Happily, nobody was at home yet but themselves.</p>

<p>"Now, mother," said Nettie, when she had
changed her dress and come to the common
room, "what's to be for supper? I'll get it.
You sit still and read, if you want to, while it's
quiet. What must we have?"</p>

<p>"There is not a great deal to do," said Mrs.
Mathieson. "I boiled the pork this morning,
and that was what set your father up so; that's
ready; and he says there must be cakes. The
potatoes are all ready to put down&mdash;I was going
to boil 'em this morning, and he stopped me."</p>

<p>Nettie looked grave about the cakes.</p>

<p>"However, mother," she said, "I don't believe
that little loaf of bread would last, even if you
and I didn't touch it; it is not very big."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson wearily sat down and took her
Testament, as Nettie begged her; and Nettie
put on the kettle and the pot of potatoes, and
made the cakes ready to bake. The table was
set, and the treacle and everything on it, except
the hot things, when Barry burst in.</p>

<p>"Hallo, cakes!&mdash;hallo, treacle!" he shouted.
"Pork and treacle&mdash;that's the right sort of thing.
Now we're going to live something like."</p>

<p>"Hush, Barry, don't make such a noise," said
his sister. "You know it's Sunday evening."</p>

<p>"Sunday! well, what about Sunday? What's
Sunday good for, except to eat, I should like to
know?"</p>

<p>"O Barry!"</p>

<p>"O Barry!" said he, mimicking her. "Come,
shut up, and fry your cake. Father and Lumber
will be here just now."</p>

<p>Nettie hushed, as she was bidden; and as soon
as her father's step was heard below, she went to
frying cakes with all her might. She just turned
her head to give one look at Mr. Lumber as he
came in. He appeared to her very like her father,
but without the recommendation which her
affection gave to Mr. Mathieson. A big, strong,
burly fellow, with the same tinges of red about
his face that the summer sun had never brought
there. Nettie did not want to look again.</p>

<p>She had a good specimen this evening of what
they might expect in future. Mrs. Mathieson
poured out the tea, and Nettie baked the cakes;
and perhaps because she was almost faint for
want of something to eat, she thought no three
people ever ate so many griddle cakes before at
one meal. In vain plateful after plateful went
upon the board, and Nettie baked them as fast
as she could; they were eaten just as fast; and
when finally the chairs were pushed back, and
the men went downstairs, Nettie and her mother
looked at each other.</p>

<p>"There's only one left, mother," said Nettie.</p>

<p>"And he has certainly eaten half the piece of
pork," said Mrs. Mathieson. "Come, child, take
something yourself; you're ready to drop. I'll
clear away."</p>

<p>But it is beyond the power of any disturbance
to take away the gladness of a heart where Jesus
is. Nettie's bread was sweet to her, even that
evening. Before she had well finished her supper,
her father and his lodger came back. They sat
down on either side the fire, and began to talk
of politics, and of their work on which they were
then engaged, with their employers and their
fellow-workmen; of the state of business in the
village, and profits and losses, and the success of
particular men in making money. They talked
loudly and eagerly; and Nettie had to go round
and round them to get to the fire for hot water,
and back to the table to wash up the cups and
plates. Her mother was helping at the table,
but to get round Mr. Lumber to the pot of hot
water on the fire every now and then, fell to
Nettie's share. It was not a very nice ending of
her sweet Sabbath day, she thought. The dishes
were done and put away, and still the talk went
on as hard as ever. It was sometimes a pleasure
to Nettie's father to hear her sing hymns of a
Sunday evening. Nettie watched for a chance,
and the first time there was a lull of the voices
of the two men, she asked softly,</p>

<p>"Shall I sing, father?"</p>

<p>Mr. Mathieson hesitated, and then answered,</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;better not, Nettie: Mr. Lumber might
not find it amusing;" and the talk began again.</p>

<p>Nettie waited a little longer, feeling exceedingly
tired. Then she rose and lighted a candle.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Nettie?" her mother
said.</p>

<p>"I am going to bed, mother."</p>

<p>"You can't take a candle up there, child! the
attic's all full of things, and you would certainly
set us on fire."</p>

<p>"I'll take great care, mother."</p>

<p>"But you can't, child! The wind might blow
the snuff of your candle right into something
that would be all a-flame by the time you're
asleep. You must manage without a light
somehow."</p>

<p>"But I can't see to find my way," said Nettie,
who was secretly trembling with fear.</p>

<p>"I'll light you then, for once, and you'll soon
learn the way. Give me the candle."</p>

<p>Nettie hushed the words that came crowding
into her mouth, and clambered up the steep stairs
to the attic. Mrs. Mathieson followed her with
the candle till she got to the top, and there she
held it till Nettie had found her way to the
other end where her bed was. Then she said
"Good night!" and went down.</p>

<p>The little square shutter of the window was
open, and a ray of moonlight streamed in upon
the bed. It was nicely made up: Nettie saw
that her mother had been there and had done
that for her, and wrought a little more space and
order among the things around the bed. But
the moonlight did not get in far enough to show
much more. Just a little of this thing and of
that could be seen; a corner of a chest, or a
gleam on the side of a meal-bag: the half-light
showed nothing clearly except the confused fulness
of the little attic. Nettie had given her
head a blow against a piece of timber as she
came through it; and she sat down upon her
little bed, feeling rather miserable. Her fear
was that the rats might visit her up there. She
did not certainly know that there were rats in
the attic, but she had been fearing to think of
them, and did not dare to ask, as well as unwilling
to give trouble to her mother; for if
they <i>did</i> come there, Nettie did not see how the
matter could be mended. She sat down on her
little bed, so much frightened that she forgot
how tired she was. Her ears were as sharp as
needles, listening to hear the scrape of a rat's
tooth upon a timber, or the patter of his feet over
the floor.</p>

<p>For a few minutes Nettie almost thought she
could not sleep up there alone, and must go
down and implore her mother to let her spread
her bed in a corner of her room. But what a
bustle that would make! Her mother would be
troubled, and her father would be angry, and the
lodger would be disturbed, and there was no
telling how much harm would come of it. No;
the peacemaker of the family must not do that.
And then the words floated into Nettie's mind
again, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
shall be called the children of God." Like a
strain of the sweetest music it floated in; and if
an angel had come and brought the words
straight to Nettie, she could not have been more
comforted. She felt the rats could not hurt her
while she was within hearing of that music; and
she got up and kneeled down upon the chest
under the little window, and looked out.</p>

<p>It was like the day that had passed, not like
the evening. So purely and softly the moon-beams
lay on all the fields and trees and hills,
there was no sign of anything but peace and
purity to be seen. No noise of men's work or
voices; no clangour of the iron foundry which
on week-days might be heard; no sight of anything
unlovely; but the wide beauty which God
had made, and the still peace and light which He
had spread over it. Every little flapping leaf
seemed to Nettie to tell of its Maker; and the
music of those words seemed to be all through
the still air&mdash;"Blessed are the peacemakers, for
they shall be called the children of God." Tears
of gladness and hope slowly gathered in Nettie's
eyes. The children of God will enter in, by-and-bye,
through those pearly gates, into that city of
gold "where they need no candle, neither light
of the sun, for the Lord God giveth them light."</p>

<p>"So He can give me light here&mdash;or what's
better than light," thought Nettie. "God isn't
only out there, in all that beautiful moonlight
world&mdash;He is here in my poor little attic too;
and He will take just as good care of me as He
does of the birds, and better, for I am His child,
and they are only His beautiful little servants."</p>

<p>Nettie's fear was gone. She prayed her evening
prayer, and trusted herself to the Lord Jesus to
take care of her; and then she undressed herself
and lay down and went to sleep, just as quietly
as any sparrow of them all, with its head under
its wing.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/i059a.jpg" width="90" alt="N" title="" /></div><div class="noindent">ettie's attic grew to be a very pleasant
place to her. She never heard the least
sound of rats; and it was so nicely out of the
way. Barry never came up there, and there she
could not even hear the voices of her father and
Mr. Lumber. She had a tired time of it down
stairs.</div>

<p>The first afternoon was a good specimen of
the way things went on. Nettie's mornings were
always spent at school; Mrs. Mathieson would
have that, as she said, whether she could get on
without Nettie or no. From the time Nettie got
home till she went to bed she was as busy as she
could be. There was so much bread to make
and so much beef and pork to boil, and so much
washing of pots and kettles; and at meal-times
there was often cakes to fry, besides all the other
preparations. Mr. Mathieson seemed to have
made up his mind that his lodger's rent should
all go to the table and be eaten up immediately;
but the difficulty was to make as much as he expected
of it in that line; for now he brought none
of his own earnings home, and Mrs. Mathieson
had more than a sad guess where they went. By
degrees he came to be very little at home in the
evenings, and he carried off Barry with him.
Nettie saw her mother burdened with a great
outward and inward care at once, and stood in
the breach all she could. She worked to the
extent of her strength, and beyond it, in the
endless getting and clearing away of meals; and
watching every chance, when the men were out
of the way, she would coax her mother to sit
down and read a chapter in her Testament.</p>

<p>"It will rest you so, mother," Nettie would
say; "and I will make the bread just as soon as
I get the dishes done. Do let me! I like to do it."</p>

<p>Sometimes Mrs. Mathieson could not be
persuaded; sometimes she would yield, in a despondent
kind of way, and sit down with the
Testament, and look at it as if neither there nor
anywhere else in the universe could she find rest
or comfort any more.</p>

<p>"It don't signify, child," said she, one afternoon
when Nettie had been urging her to sit
down and read. "I haven't the heart to do anything.
We're all driving to rack and ruin just
as fast as we can go."</p>

<p>"Oh no, mother," said Nettie, "I don't think
we are."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it. I see it coming every day.
Every day it is a little worse; and Barry is going
along with your father; and they are destroying
me among them, body and soul too."</p>

<p>"No, mother," said Nettie, "I don't think that.
I have prayed the Lord Jesus, and you know He
has promised to hear prayer; and I know we are
not going to ruin."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> are not, child, I believe; but you are
the only one of us that isn't. I wish I was dead,
to be out of my misery!"</p>

<p>"Sit down, mother, and read a little bit; and
don't talk so. Do, mother! It will be an hour
or more yet to supper, and I'll get it ready. You
sit down and read, and I'll make the shortcakes.
Do, mother! and you'll feel better."</p>

<p>It was half despair and half persuasion that
made her do it; but Mrs. Mathieson did sit down
by the open window and take her Testament;
and Nettie flew quietly about, making her shortcakes
and making up the fire and setting the
table, and through it all casting many a loving
glance over to the open book in her mother's
hand, and the weary, stony face that was bent
over it. Nettie had not said how her own back
was aching, and she forgot it almost in her business
and her thoughts; though by the time her
work was done her head was aching wearily too.
But cakes and table and fire and everything else
were in readiness; and Nettie stole up behind
her mother and leaned over her shoulder&mdash;leaned
a little heavily.</p>

<p>"Don't that chapter comfort you, mother?"
she whispered.</p>

<p>"No. It don't seem to me as I've got any
feeling left," said Mrs. Mathieson.</p>

<p>It was the fourth chapter of John at which they
were both looking.</p>

<p>"Don't it comfort you to read of Jesus being
wearied?" Nettie went on, her head lying on her
mother's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why should it, child?"</p>

<p>"I like to read it," said Nettie. "Then I know
He knows how I feel sometimes."</p>

<p>"God knows everything, Nettie."</p>

<p>With that Mrs. Mathieson cast down her book
and burst into such a passion of weeping that
Nettie was frightened. It was like the breaking
up of an icy winter. She flung her apron over
her head and sobbed aloud; till, hearing the steps
of the men upon the staircase, she rushed off to
Barry's room, and presently got quiet, for she
came out to supper as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>From that time there was a gentler mood upon
her mother; Nettie saw, though she looked weary
and careworn as ever, there was now not often the
hard, dogged look which had been wont to be
there for months past. Nettie had no difficulty
to get her to read the Testament; and of all
things, what she liked was to get a quiet hour of
an evening alone with Nettie, and hear her sing
hymns. But both Nettie and she had a great
deal, as Mrs. Mathieson said, "to put up with."</p>

<p>As weeks went on, the father of the family was
more and more out at nights, and less and less
agreeable when he was at home. He and his
friend Lumber helped each other in mischief.
The lodger's rent and board had been at first
given for the household daily expenses; but then
Mr. Mathieson began to pay over a smaller sum,
saying that it was all that was due; and Mrs.
Mathieson began to suspect that the rest had
been paid away already for brandy. Then Mr.
Mathieson told her to trade at Jackson's on account,
and he would settle the bill. Mrs. Mathieson
held off from this as long as it was possible.
She and Nettie did their very best to make the
little that was given them go a good way: they
wasted not a crumb nor a penny. By degrees it
came to be very customary for Mrs. Mathieson
and Nettie to make their meal of porridge and
bread, after all the more savoury food had been
devoured by the others; and many a weary patch
and darn filled the night hours because they had
not money to buy a cheap dress or two. Nettie
bore it very patiently. Mrs. Mathieson was sometimes
impatient.</p>

<p>"This won't last me through the week, to get
the things you want," she said one Saturday to
her husband, when he gave her what he said was
Lumber's payment to him.</p>

<p>"You'll have to make it last," said he gruffly.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me how I'm going to do that?
Here isn't more than half what you gave me at
first."</p>

<p>"Send to Jackson's for what you want!" he
roared at her; "didn't I tell you so? and don't
come bothering me with your noise."</p>

<p>"When will you pay Jackson?"</p>

<p>"I'll pay you first!" he said, with an oath, and
very violently. It was a ruder word than he had
ever said to her before, and Mrs. Mathieson was
staggered for a moment by it; but there was
another word she was determined to say.</p>

<p>"May do what you like to me," she said, doggedly;
"but I should think you would see for
yourself that Nettie has too much to get on with.
She is getting just as thin and pale as she can be."</p>

<p>"That's just your fool's nonsense!" said Mr.
Mathieson; but he spoke it more quietly. Nettie
just then entered the room.</p>

<p>"Here, Nettie, what ails you? Come here.
Let's look at you. Ain't you as strong as ever
you was? Here's your mother says you're
getting puny."</p>

<p>Nettie's smile and answer were so placid and
untroubled, and the little colour that rose in her
cheeks at her father's question made her look so
fresh and well, that he was quieted. He drew
her within his arms, for his gentle, dutiful little
daughter had a place in his respect and affection
both, though he did not often show it very
broadly; but now he kissed her.</p>

<p>"There!" said he; "don't you go to growing
thin and weak without telling me, for I don't like
such doings. You tell me when you want anything."
But with that Mr. Mathieson got up
and went off out of the house; and Nettie had
small chance to tell him if she wanted anything.
However, this little word and kiss were a great
comfort and pleasure to her. It was the last she
had from him in a good while.</p>

<p>Nettie, however, was not working for praise or
kisses, and very little of either she got. Generally
her father was rough, imperious, impatient, speaking
fast enough if anything went wrong, but very
sparing in expressions of pleasure. Sometimes
a blessing did come upon her from the very depth
of Mrs. Mathieson's heart, and went straight to
Nettie's; but it was for another blessing she
laboured, and prayed, and waited.</p>

<p>As the summer passed away, it began to grow
cold, too, up in her garret. Nettie had never
thought of that. As long as the summer sun
warmed the roof well in the day, and only the
soft summer wind played in and out of her window
at night, it was all very well, and Nettie
thought her sleeping-chamber was the best in the
whole house, for it was nearest the sky. But
August departed with its sunny days, and September
grew cool in the evening; and October
brought still sunny days, it is true, but the
nights had a clear sharp frost in them; and Nettie
was obliged to cover herself up warm in bed and
look at the moonlight and the stars as she could
see them through the little square opening left
by the shutter. The stars looked very lovely to
Nettie, when they peeped at her so in her bed
out of their high heaven; and she was very
content.</p>

<p>Then came November; and the winds began
to come into the garret, not only through the
open window, but through every crack between
two boards. The whole garret was filled with
the winds, Nettie thought. It was hard work
managing then. Shutting the shutter would bar
out the stars, but not the wind, she found; and
to keep from being quite chilled through at her
times of prayer, morning and evening, Nettie
used to take the blanket and coverlets from the
bed, and wrap herself in them. It was all she
could do. Still, she forgot the inconveniences;
and her little garret chamber seemed to Nettie
very near heaven, as well as near the sky.</p>

<p>But all this way of life did not make her grow
strong or rosy; and though Nettie never told her
father that she wanted anything, her mother's
heart measured the times when it ought to be
told.</p>

<span class="small">"How long, O Lord?"&mdash;<i>Rev.</i> vi. 10.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/i059a.jpg" width="90" alt="N" title="" /></div><div class="noindent">ovember days drew toward an end;
December was near. One afternoon
Mrs. Mathieson, wanting Nettie, went to the foot
of the garret stairs to call her.</div>

<p>"Yes, mother. Coming."</p>

<p>"Fetch down your school cloak, child."</p>

<p>She went back to her room, and presently
Nettie came in with the cloak, looking placid as
usual, but very pale.</p>

<p>"Somebody's got to go to Mr. Jackson's, but
you ain't fit, child; you ate next to nothing at
noon. You can't live on porridge."</p>

<p>"I like it, mother; but I wasn't hungry. What's
wanting from Jackson's?"</p>

<p>Nettie put on her cloak, and took her basket,
and went out. It was after sundown already,
and a keen wind swept through the village street,
and swept through Nettie's brown cloak too,
tight as she wrapt it about her. But though she
was cold and blue, and the wind seemed to go
through <i>her</i> as well as the cloak, Nettie was
thinking of something else. She knew that her
mother had eaten a very scanty, poor sort of
dinner, as well as herself, and that <i>she</i> often
looked pale and wan; and Nettie was almost
ready to wish she had not given the last penny
of her shilling on Sunday to the missionary-box.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" said Mr. Jackson, rather
curtly, when Nettie's turn came to be served, and
she had told her errand. "What!" he exclaimed,
"seven pounds of meal, and a pound of butter,
and two pounds of sugar! Well, you tell your
father that I should like to have my bill settled;
it's all drawn up, you see, and I don't like to
open a new account till it's all square."</p>

<p>He turned away immediately to another customer,
and Nettie felt she had got her answer.
She stood a moment, very disappointed, and a
little mortified, and somewhat downhearted.
What should they do for supper? and what a
storm there would be when her father heard
about all this, and found nothing but bread and
tea on the table! Slowly Nettie turned away,
and slowly made the few steps from the door to
the corner. She felt very blue indeed; coming
out of the warm store, the chill wind made her
shiver. Just at the corner somebody stopped her.</p>

<p>"Nettie!" said the voice of the little French
baker, "what ails you? you look not well."</p>

<p>Nettie gave her a grateful smile, and said she
was well.</p>

<p>"You look not like it," said Madame Auguste;
"you look as if the wind might carry you off
before you get home. Come to my house; I
want to see you in the light."</p>

<p>"I haven't time; I must go home to mother,
Mrs. August."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know! You will go home all the faster
for coming this way first. You have not been to
see me in these three or four weeks."</p>

<p>She carried Nettie along with her; it was but
a step, and Nettie did not feel capable of resisting
anything. The little Frenchwoman put her into
the shop before her, made her sit down, and
lighted a candle. The shop was nice and warm,
and full of the savoury smell of fresh baking.</p>

<p>"We have made our own bread lately," said
Nettie, in answer to the charge of not coming
there.</p>

<p>"Do you make it good?" said Madame
Auguste.</p>

<p>"It isn't like yours, Mrs. August," said Nettie,
smiling.</p>

<p>"If you will come and live with me next summer,
I will teach you how to do some things;
and you shall not look so blue neither. Have
you had your supper?"</p>

<p>"No; and I am just going home to get supper.
I must go, Mrs. August."</p>

<p>"You come in here," said the Frenchwoman;
"you are my prisoner. I am all alone, and I
want somebody for company. You take off your
cloak, Nettie, and I shall give you something to
keep the wind out. You do what I bid you!"</p>

<p>Nettie felt too cold and weak to make any ado
about complying, unless duty had forbade; and
she thought there was time enough yet. She let
her cloak drop, and took off her hood. The little
back room to which Madame Auguste had
brought her was only a trifle bigger than the bit
of a shop; but it was as cozy as it was little. A
tiny stove warmed it, and kept warm, too, a tiny
iron pot and tea-kettle, which were steaming
away. The bed was at one end, draped nicely
with red curtains; there was a little looking-glass,
and some prints in frames round the walls;
there was Madame's little table covered with a
purple cloth, and with her work and a small
clock and various pretty things on it. Madame
Auguste had gone to a cupboard in the wall, and
taken out a couple of plates and little bowls,
which she set on a little round stand; and then
lifting the cover of the pot on the stove, she
ladled out a bowlful of what was in it, and gave
it to Nettie with one of her nice crisp rolls.</p>

<p>"Eat that!" she said. "I shan't let you go
home till you have swallowed that to keep the
cold out. It makes me all freeze to look at you."</p>

<p>So she filled her own bowl, and made good
play with her spoon, while between spoonfuls
she looked at Nettie; and the good little woman
smiled in her heart to see how easy it was for
Nettie to obey her. The savoury, simple, comforting
broth she had set before her was the best
thing to the child's delicate stomach that she
had tasted for many a day.</p>

<p>"Is it good?" said the Frenchwoman, when
Nettie's bowl was half empty.</p>

<p>"It's so good!" said Nettie. "I didn't know
I was so hungry."</p>

<p>"Now you will not feel the cold so," said the
Frenchwoman, "and you will go back quicker.
Do you like my <i>riz-au-gras</i>?"</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> is it, ma'am?" said Nettie.</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman laughed, and made Nettie
say it over till she could pronounce the words.</p>

<p>"Now you like it," she said, "that is a French
dish. Do you think Mrs. Mat'ieson would like
it?"</p>

<p>"I am sure she would!" said Nettie. "But I
don't know how to make it."</p>

<p>"You shall come here, and I will teach it to
you. And now you shall carry a little home to
your mother, and ask her if she will do the honour
to a French dish to approve it. It do not cost
anything. I cannot sell much bread the winters;
I live on what cost me nothing."</p>

<p>While saying this, Madame Auguste had filled
a little pail with the <i>riz-au-gras</i>, and put a couple
of her rolls along with it. "It must have the
French bread," she said; and she gave it to
Nettie, who looked quite cheered up, and very
grateful.</p>

<p>"You are a good little girl!" she said. "How
keep you always your face looking so happy?
There is always one little streak of sunshine
here"&mdash;drawing her finger across above Nettie's
eyebrows&mdash;"and another here,"&mdash;and her finger
passed over the line of Nettie's lips.</p>

<p>"That's because I <i>am</i> happy, Mrs. August."</p>

<p>"<i>Always?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, always."</p>

<p>"What makes you so happy always? You
was just the same in the cold winter out there,
as when you was eating my <i>riz-au-gras</i>. Now,
me&mdash;I am cross in the cold, and not happy."</p>

<p>But the Frenchwoman saw a deeper light come
into Nettie's eyes as she answered,</p>

<p>"It is because I love the Lord Jesus, Mrs.
August, and He makes me happy."</p>

<p>"<i>You?</i>" said Madame. "My child! What
do you say, Nettie? I think not I have heard
you right."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. August, I am happy because I love
Jesus. I know He loves me, and He will take
me to be with Him."</p>

<p>"Not just yet," said the Frenchwoman, "I
hope. Well, I wish I was so happy as you,
Nettie. Good bye!"</p>

<p>Nettie ran home, more comforted by her good
supper, and more thankful to the goodness of
God in giving it, and happy in the feeling of His
goodness, than can be told. And very, very glad
she was of that little tin pail in her hand she
knew her mother needed. Mrs. Mathieson had
time to eat the rice broth before her husband
came in.</p>

<p>"She said she would show me how to make
it," said Nettie, "and it don't cost anything."</p>

<p>"Why, it's just rice and&mdash;<i>what</i> is it? I don't
see," said Mrs. Mathieson. "It isn't rice and
milk."</p>

<p>Nettie laughed at her mother.</p>

<p>"Mrs. August didn't tell. She called it reeso&mdash;I
forget what she called it!"</p>

<p>"It's the best thing I ever saw," said Mrs.
Mathieson. "There&mdash;put the pail away. Your
father's coming."</p>

<p>He was in a terrible humour, as they expected;
and Nettie and her mother had a sad evening of
it. And the same sort of thing lasted for several
days. Mrs. Mathieson hoped that perhaps Mr.
Lumber would take into his head to seek lodgings
somewhere else, or, at least, that Mathieson
would have been shamed into paying Jackson's
bill; but neither thing happened. Mr. Lumber
found his quarters too comfortable; and Mr.
Mathieson spent too much of his earnings on
drink to find the amount necessary to clear off
the scores at the grocer's shop.</p>

<p>From that time, as they could run up no new
account, the family were obliged to live on what
they could immediately pay for. That was seldom
a sufficient supply; and so, in dread of the storms
that came whenever their wants touched Mr.
Mathieson's own comfort, Nettie and her mother
denied themselves constantly what they very
much needed. The old can sometimes bear this
better than the young. Nettie grew more delicate,
more thin, and more feeble every day. It
troubled her mother sadly. Mr. Mathieson could
not be made to see it. Indeed, he was little at
home except when he was eating.</p>

<img src="images/i079a.jpg" width="90" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class="noindent">t was very cold up in Nettie's garret now;
the winter had moved on into the latter
part of December, and the frosts were very keen;
and the winter winds seemed to come in at one
end of the attic and to just sweep through to the
other, bringing all except the snow with them.
Even the snow often drifted in through the cracks
of the rough wainscoat board, or under the shutter,
and lay in little white streaks or heaps on the
floor, and never melted. To-night there was no
wind, and Nettie had left her shutter open, that
she might see the stars as she lay in bed. It did
not make much difference in the feeling of the
place, for it was about as cold inside as out; and
the stars were great friends of Nettie's. How
bright they looked down to-night! It was very
cold, and lying awake made Nettie colder: she
shivered sometimes under all her coverings; still
she lay looking at the stars in that square patch
of sky that her shutter-opening gave her to see,
and thinking of the Golden City. "They shall
hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither
shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For
the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne
shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living
fountains of waters; and God shall wipe all tears
from their eyes."</div>

<p>"His servants shall serve Him,"&mdash;thought
Nettie; "and mother will be there, and Barry&mdash;and
I shall be there! and then I shall be happy.
And I am happy now. 'Blessed be the Lord,
which hath not turned away my prayer, nor His
mercy from me!'" And if that verse went
through Nettie's head once, it did fifty times:
so did this one, which the quiet stars seemed to
repeat and whisper to her, "The Lord redeemeth
the soul of His servants, and none of them that
trust in Him shall be desolate." And though now
and then a shiver passed over Nettie's shoulders
with the cold, she was ready to sing for very
gladness and fulness of heart.</p>

<p>But lying awake and shivering did not do
Nettie's little body any good; she looked so
very white the next day that it caught even Mr.
Mathieson's attention. He reached out his arm
and drew Nettie toward him, as she was passing
between the cupboard and the table. Then he
looked at her, but he did not say how she looked.</p>

<p>"Do you know the day after to-morrow is
Christmas Day?" said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. It's the day when Christ was
born," said Nettie.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know anything about that,"
said her father; "but what I mean is, that a week
after is New Year. What would you like me to
give you, Nettie,&mdash;hey?"</p>

<p>Nettie stood still for a moment, then her eyes
lighted up.</p>

<p>"Will you give it to me, father, if I tell you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. If it is not extravagant, perhaps
I will."</p>

<p>"It will not cost much," said Nettie, earnestly.
"Will you give me what I choose, father, if it
does not cost too much?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I will. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Father, you won't be displeased?"</p>

<p>"Not I!" said Mr. Mathieson, drawing Nettie's
little form tighter in his grasp: he thought he
had never felt it so slight and thin before.</p>

<p>"Father, I am going to ask you a great thing!&mdash;to
go to church with me New Year's Day."</p>

<p>"To church!" said her father, frowning; but
he remembered his promise, and he felt Nettie
in his arms yet. "What on earth good will that
do you?"</p>

<p>"A great deal of good. It would please me
so much, father."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to go to church for?"
said Mr. Mathieson, not sure yet what humour
he was going to be in.</p>

<p>"To thank God, father, that there was a Christmas,
when Jesus came, that we might have a
New Year."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what!" said Mr. Mathieson. "What
are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Because, father," said Nettie, trembling, and
seizing her chance, "since Jesus loved us, and
came and died for us, we all may have a New
Year of glory. I shall, father; and I want you
too. Oh do, father!" and Nettie burst into tears.</p>

<p>Mr. Mathieson held her fast, and his face showed
a succession of changes for a minute or so. But
she presently raised her head and kissed him, and
said,</p>

<p>"May I have what I want, father?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;go along," said Mr. Mathieson. "I
should like to know how to refuse you, though.
But, Nettie, don't you want me to give you anything
else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else!" she told him, with her face
all shining with joy.</p>

<p>Mr. Mathieson looked at her, and seemed very
thoughtful all supper-time.</p>

<p>"Can't you strengthen that child up a bit?"
he said to his wife afterwards. "She does too
much."</p>

<p>"She does as little as I can help," said Mrs.
Mathieson, "but she is always at something. I
am afraid her room is too cold o' nights. She
ain't fit to bear it. It's bitter up there."</p>

<p>"Give her another blanket or quilt, then," said
her husband. "I should think you would see to
that. Does she say she is cold?"</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;never, except sometimes when I see her
looking blue, and ask her."</p>

<p>"And what does she say then?"</p>

<p>"She says sometimes she is a little cold," said
Mrs. Mathieson.</p>

<p>"Well, do put something more over her, and
have no more of it!" said her husband, violently.
"Sit still and let the child be cold, when another
covering would make it all right!"&mdash;and he ended
with swearing at her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson did not dare to tell him that
Nettie's food was not of a sufficiently nourishing
kind: she knew what the answer to that would
be; and she feared that a word more about Nettie's
sleeping-room would be thought an attack
upon Mr. Lumber's being in the house. So she
was silent.</p>

<p>But there came home something for Nettie in
the course of the Christmas week, which comforted
her a little, and perhaps quieted Mr. Mathieson
too. He brought with him, on coming home to
supper one evening, a great thick roll of a bundle,
and put it in Nettie's arms, telling her that was
for her New Year.</p>

<p>"For me?" said Nettie, the colour starting a
little into her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Yes, for you. Open it, and see."</p>

<p>So Nettie did, with some trouble, and there
tumbled out upon the floor a great heavy warm
blanket, new from the shop. Mr. Mathieson
thought the pink in her cheeks was the prettiest
thing he had seen in a long while.</p>

<p>"Is this for <i>me</i>, father?"</p>

<p>"I mean it to be so. See if it will go on that
bed of yours, and keep you warm."</p>

<p>Nettie gave her father some very hearty thanks,
which he took in a silent, pleased way; and then
she hastened off with her blanket upstairs. How
thick and warm it was! and how nicely it would
keep her comfortable when she knelt all wrapped
up in it on that cold floor! For a little while it
would; not even a warm blanket would keep her
from the cold more than a little while at a time
up there. But Nettie tried its powers the first
thing she did.</p>

<p>Did Mr. Mathieson mean the blanket to take
the place of his promise? Nettie thought of that,
but like a wise child she said nothing at all till the
Sunday morning came. Then, before she set off
for Sunday school, she came to her father's elbow.</p>

<p>"Father, I'll be home at a quarter after ten;
will you be ready then?"</p>

<p>"Ready for what?" said Mr. Mathieson.</p>

<p>"For my New Year's gift," said Nettie. "You
know you promised I should go to church with
you."</p>

<p>"Did I? And ain't you going to take the
blanket for your New Year's gift, and let me off,
Nettie?"</p>

<p>"No, father, to be sure not. I'll be home at
a quarter past; please don't forget." And Nettie
went off to school very thankful and happy, for
her father's tone was not unkind. How glad she
was New Year's Day had come on Sunday!</p>

<p>Mr. Mathieson was as good as his word. He
was ready at the time, and they walked to the
church together. That was a great day to Nettie.
Her father and mother going to church in company
with her and with each other! And when
they got to church, it seemed as if every word of
the prayers, and of the reading, and of the hymns,
and of the sermon, struck on all Nettie's nerves
of hearing and feeling. Would her father understand
any of those sweet words? would he feel
them? would they reach him? Nettie little thought
that what he felt most, what <i>did</i> reach him, though
he did not thoroughly understand it, was the look
of her own face, though she never but once dared
turn it toward him. There was a little colour in it
more than usual; her eye was deep in its earnestness;
and the grave set of her little mouth was
broken up now and then in a way that Mr. Mathieson
wanted to watch better than the straight
sides of her sun-bonnet would let him. Once he
thought he saw something more.</p>

<p>He walked home very soberly, and was a good
deal on the silent order during the rest of the day.
He did not go to church in the afternoon. But
in the evening, as her mother was busy in and out
getting supper ready, and Mr. Lumber had not
come in, Mr. Mathieson called Nettie to his side.</p>

<p>"What were you crying for in church this forenoon?"
he said low.</p>

<p>"Crying!" said Nettie, surprised. "Was I crying?"</p>

<p>"If it wasn't tears I saw dropping from under
your hands on to the floor, it must have been
some drops of rain that had got there, and I don't
see how they could very well. There warn't no
rain outside. What was it for, hey?"</p>

<p>There came a great flush all over Nettie's face,
and she did not at once speak.</p>

<p>"Hey?&mdash;what was it for?"&mdash;repeated Mr.
Mathieson.</p>

<p>The flush passed away. Nettie spoke very
low, and with lips all of a quiver. "I remember.
I was thinking, father, how 'all things are ready'&mdash;and
I couldn't help wishing that you were ready
too."</p>

<p>"Ready for what?" said Mr. Mathieson, somewhat
roughly. "All things ready for what?"</p>

<p>"Ready for you," said Nettie. "Jesus is ready
to love you, and calls you&mdash;and the angels are
ready to rejoice for you&mdash;and I<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>"</p>

<p>"Go on. What of you?"</p>

<p>Nettie lifted her eyes to him. "I am ready to
rejoice too, father."</p>

<p>But the time of rejoicing was not yet. Nettie
burst into tears.</p>

<p>Mr. Mathieson was not angry, yet he flung
away from her with a rude "Pshaw!" and that
was all the answer she got. But the truth was,
that there was something in Nettie's look of tenderness,
and purity, and trembling hope, that her
father's heart could not bear to meet; and, what
is more, that he was never able to forget.</p>

<p>Nettie went about her evening business, helping
her mother, and keeping back the tears which
were very near again; and Mr. Mathieson began
to talk with Mr. Lumber, and everything was to
all appearance just as it had been hitherto. And
so it went on after that.</p>

</div><div class="noindent">t grew colder and colder in Nettie's garret&mdash;or
else she grew thinner and felt it
more. She certainly thought it was
colder. The snow came, and piled a thick covering
on the roof, and stopped up some of the
chinks in the clapboarding with its white caulking;
and that made the place a little better: then
the winds from off the snow-covered country were
keen and bitter.</div>

<p>One morning Nettie went to Barry secretly in
his room, and asked him to bring the pail of water
from the spring for her. Barry had no mind to
the job.</p>

<p>"Why can't mother do it," he said, "if you
can't?"</p>

<p>"Mother is busy and hasn't a minute. I always
do it for her."</p>

<p>"Well, why can't you go on doing it? You're
accustomed to it, you see, and I don't like going
out so early," said Barry, stretching himself.</p>

<p>"I would, and I wouldn't ask you, only, Barry,
somehow I don't think I'm quite strong lately,
and I can hardly bring the pail&mdash;it's so heavy to
me. I have to stop and rest ever so many times
before I can get to the house with it."</p>

<p>"Well, if you stop and rest, I suppose it won't
hurt you," said Barry. "<i>I</i> should want to stop
and rest too, myself."</p>

<p>His little sister was turning away, giving it up,
when she was met by her father, who stepped in
from the entry. He looked red with anger.</p>

<p>"You take the pail, and go get the water!" said
he to his son; "and you hear me! Don't you let
Nettie bring in another pailful when you're at
home, or I'll turn you out of the house. You
lazy scoundrel! You don't deserve the bread you
eat. Would you let her work for you, when you
are as strong as sixty?"</p>

<p>Barry's grumbled words in answer were so very
unsatisfactory, that Mr. Mathieson in a rage advanced
towards him with uplifted fist; but Nettie
sprang in between, and very nearly caught the
blow that was meant for her brother.</p>

<p>"Please, father, don't!" she cried;&mdash;"please,
father, don't be angry! Barry didn't think&mdash;he
didn't<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>"</p>

<p>"Why didn't he?" said Mr. Mathieson. "Great
lazy rascal! He wants to be flogged."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!" said Nettie: "he didn't know why
I asked him, or he wouldn't have refused me."</p>

<p>"Why did you, then?"</p>

<p>"Because it made my back ache so to bring it&mdash;I
couldn't help asking him."</p>

<p>"Did you ever ask him before?"</p>

<p>"Never mind, please, father!" said Nettie,
sweetly. "Just don't think about me, and don't
be angry with Barry. It's no matter now."</p>

<p>"Who does think about you? Your mother
don't, or she would have seen to this before."</p>

<p>"Mother didn't know my back ached. Father,
you know she hasn't a minute: she is so busy
getting breakfast in time; and she didn't know
I wasn't strong enough. Father, don't tell her,
please, I asked Barry. It would worry her so.
Please don't, father."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> think of folks, anyhow. You're a regular
peacemaker!" exclaimed Mr. Mathieson, as he
turned away and left her. Nettie stood still, the
flush paling on her cheek, her hand pressed to her
side.</p>

<p>"Am I that?" she thought. "Shall I be that?
O Lord, my Saviour, my dear Redeemer, send
Thy peace here!" She was still in the same
place and position when Barry came in again.</p>

<p>"It's wretched work!" he exclaimed, under
his breath, for his father was in the next room.
"It's as slippery as the plague going down that
path to the water: it's no use to have legs, for
you can't hold up. I'm all froze stiff with the
water I've spilt on me!"</p>

<p>"I know it's very slippery," said Nettie.</p>

<p>"And then you can't get at the water when
you're there, without stepping into it&mdash;it's filled
chuck full of snow and ice all over the edge. It's
the most wretched work!"</p>

<p>"I know it, Barry," said Nettie. "I am sorry
you have to do it."</p>

<p>"Why did you make me do it, then?" said he
angrily. "You got it your own way this time.
But never mind; I'll be even with you for it."</p>

<p>"Barry," said his sister, "please do it just a
little while for me, till I get stronger and don't
mind; and as soon as ever I can I'll do it again.
But you don't know how it made me ache all
through, bringing the pail up that path."</p>

<p>"Stuff!" said Barry. And from that time,
though he did not fail to bring the water in the
morning, yet Nettie saw he owed her a grudge
for it all the day afterward. He was almost
always away with his father, and she had little
chance to win him to better feeling.</p>

<p>So the winter slowly passed and the spring
came. Spring months came, at least; and now
and then, to be sure, a sweet spring day, when all
nature softened; the sun shone mildly, the birds
sang, the air smelt sweet with the opening buds.</p>

<p>"There's that house-raising to-morrow, Nettie,"
said Mrs. Mathieson; "it's been on my mind this
fortnight past, and it kills me."</p>

<p>"Why, mother?"</p>

<p>"I know how it will be," said Mrs. Mathieson:
"they'll have a grand set-to after they get it up,
and your father'll be in the first of it; and I
somehow feel as if it would be the finishing of
him. I wish almost he'd get ill&mdash;or anything
to keep him away. They make such a time after
a house-raising."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, don't wish that," said Nettie;
but she began to think how it would be possible
to withdraw her father from the frolic with which
the day's business would be ended. Mr. Mathieson
was a carpenter, and a fine workman, and
always had plenty of work, and was much looked
up to among his fellows.</p>

<p>Nettie began to think whether <i>she</i> could make
any effort to keep her father from the dangers
into which he was so fond of plunging. Hitherto
she had done nothing but pray for him: could
she do anything more, with any chance of good
coming of it? She thought and thought, and
resolved that she must try. It did not look
hopeful; there was little she could urge to lure
Mr. Mathieson from his drinking companions;
nothing except her own timid affection and the
one other thing it was possible to offer him&mdash;a
good supper. How to get that was not so easy;
but she consulted with her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson said she used in her younger
days to know how to make waffles<a name="fn2_r" id="fn2_r"></a><a href="#fn2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a>, and Mr.
Mathieson used to think they were the best
things that ever were made: now, if Mrs. Moss,
a neighbour, would lend her waffle-iron, and she
could get a few eggs, she believed she could
manage it still.</p>

<p>"But we haven't the eggs, child," she said;
"and I don't believe any power under heaven
can get him to come away from that raising
frolic."</p>

<p>Nor did Nettie. It was to no power <i>under</i>
heaven that she trusted. But she must use her
means. She easily got the iron from Mrs. Moss.
Then she borrowed the eggs from Madame Auguste,
who in Lent-time always had them; then
she watched with grave eyes, and many a heart-prayer
the while, the mixing and making of the
waffles.</p>

<p>"How do you manage the iron, mother?"</p>

<p>"Why, it is made hot," said Mrs. Mathieson,
"very hot, and buttered; and then, when the
batter is light, you pour it in and clap it together,
and put it in the stove."</p>

<p>"But how can you pour it in, mother? I don't
see how you can fill the iron."</p>

<p>"Why, you can't, child; you fill one half, and
shut it together: and when it bakes it rises up
and fills the other half. You'll see."</p>

<p>The first thing Nettie asked when she came
home from school in the afternoon was, if the
waffles were light?</p>

<p>She never saw any look better, Mrs. Mathieson
said. "But I forgot, child, we ought to have cinnamon
and white sugar to eat on them. It was
so that your father used to admire them; they
won't be waffles without sugar and cinnamon.
I'm afraid he'll think<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but I don't believe
you'll get him home to think anything about
them."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson ended with a sigh. Nettie said
nothing; she went round the room, putting it in
particularly nice order, then set the table. When
all that was right, she went up to her garret, and
knelt down and prayed that God would take
care of her and bless her errand. She put the
whole matter in the Lord's hands; then she
dressed herself in her hood and cloak, and went
down to her mother. Mr. Mathieson had not
come home to dinner, being busy with the
house-raising; so they had had no opportunity
to invite him, and Nettie was now on her way
to do it.</p>

<p>"It's turned a bad afternoon; I'm afraid it
ain't fit for you to go, Nettie."</p>

<p>"I don't mind," said Nettie. "Maybe I'll get
some sugar and cinnamon, mother, before I come
back."</p>

<p>"Well, you know where the raising is; it's out
on the Shallonway road, on beyond Mrs. August's
a good bit."</p>

<p>Nettie nodded and went out; and as the door
closed on her grave, sweet little face, her mother
felt a great strain on her heart. She would have
been glad to relieve herself by tears, but it was a
dry pain that would not be relieved so. She went
to the window and looked out at the weather.</p>

<img src="images/i099a.jpg" width="90" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class="noindent">he early part of the day had been brilliant
and beautiful; then, March-like,
it had changed about, gathered up a
whole skyful of clouds, and turned at last to
snowing. The large feathery flakes were falling
now fast; melting as fast as they fell; making
everything wet and chill, in the air and under the
foot. Nettie had no overshoes: she was accustomed
to get her feet wet very often, so that was
nothing new. She hugged herself in her brown
cloak, on which the beautiful snow-flakes rested
white a moment and then melted away, gradually
wetting the covering of her arms and shoulders
in a way that would reach through by-and-bye.
Nettie thought little of it. What was she thinking
of? She was comforting herself with the
thought of that strong and blessed Friend who
has promised to be always with His servants, and
remembering His promise, "They shall not be
ashamed that wait for me." What did the snow
and the wet matter to Nettie? Yet she looked
too much like a snow-flake herself when she
reached Mr. Jackson's store and went in. The
white frost had lodged all round her old black
silk hood, and even edged the shoulders of her
brown cloak; and the white little face within
looked just as pure.</div>

<p>Mr. Jackson looked at her with more than usual
attention; and when Nettie asked him if he
would let her have a shilling's-worth of fine white
sugar and cinnamon, and trust her till the next
week for the money, he made not the slightest
difficulty, but measured or weighed it out for her
directly, and even said he would trust her for
more than that. So Nettie thanked him, and
went on to the less easy part of her errand. Her
heart began to beat a little bit now.</p>

<p>The feathery snowflakes fell thicker, and made
everything wetter than ever; it was very raw and
chill, and few people were abroad. Nettie went
on, past the little bake-woman's house, and past
all the thickly built part of the village. Then
came houses more scattered&mdash;large handsome
houses, with beautiful gardens and grounds, and
handsome palings along the road-side. Past one
or two of these, and then there was a space of
wild ground; and here Mr. Jackson was putting
up a new house for himself, and meant to have a
fine place. The wild bushes grew in a thick hedge
along by the fence, but over the tops of them
Nettie could see the new timbers of the frame
that the carpenters had been raising that day.
She went on till she came to an opening in the
hedge and fence as well, and then the new building
was close before her. The men were at work
yet, finishing their day's business; the sound of
hammering rang sharp on all sides of the frame;
some were up on the ladders, some were below.
Nettie walked slowly up and then round the
place, searching for her father. At last she found
him. He and Barry, who was learning his father's
trade, were on the ground at one side of the frame,
busy as bees. Talking was going on roundly too,
as well as hammering, and Nettie drew near and
stood a few minutes without any one noticing her.
She was not in a hurry to interrupt the work nor
to tell her errand: she waited.</p>

<p>Barry saw her first, but ungraciously would not
speak to her nor for her. If she was there for anything,
he said to himself, it was for some spoil-sport;
and one pail of water a day was enough for
him. Mr. Mathieson was looking the other way.</p>

<p>"I say, Mathieson," called one of the men from
the inside of the frame, "I s'pose 'tain't worth carrying
any of this stuff&mdash;Jackson'll have enough
without it?"</p>

<p>The words were explained, to Nettie's horror,
by a jug in the man's hands, which he lifted to
his lips.</p>

<p>"Jackson will do something handsome in that
way to-night," said Nettie's father; "or he'll not
do as he's done by, such a wet evening. But I've
stood to my word, and I expect he'll stand to
his'n."</p>

<p>"He gave his word there was to be oysters,
warn't it?" called another man, from the top of
the ladder.</p>

<p>"Punch and oysters," said Mathieson, hammering
away, "or I've raised the last frame I ever
<i>will</i> raise for him. I expect he'll stand it."</p>

<p>"Oysters ain't much 'count," said another
speaker. "I'd rather have a slice of good sweet
pork any day."</p>

<p>"Father," said Nettie. She had come close up
to him, but she trembled. What possible chance
could she have?</p>

<p>"Holloa!" said Mr. Mathieson, turning suddenly.
"Nettie!&mdash;what's the matter, girl?"</p>

<p>He spoke roughly, and Nettie saw that his
face was red. She trembled all over, but spoke
as bravely as she could.</p>

<p>"Father, I am come to invite you home to
supper to-night. Mother and I have a particular
reason to want to see you. Will you come?"</p>

<p>"Come where?" said Mr. Mathieson, but half
understanding her.</p>

<p>"Come home to tea, father. I came to ask
you. Mother has made something you like."</p>

<p>"I'm busy, child. Go home. I'm going to
supper at Jackson's. Go home."</p>

<p>He turned to his hammering again. But
Nettie stood still in the snow and waited.</p>

<p>"Father," she said, after a minute, coming yet
closer and speaking more low.</p>

<p>"What! ain't you gone?" exclaimed Mr.
Mathieson.</p>

<p>"Father," said Nettie, softly, "mother has made
waffles for you; and you used to like them so
much, she says; and they are light and beautiful,
and just ready to bake. Won't you come and
have them with us? Mother says they'll be very
nice."</p>

<p>"Why didn't she make 'em another time,"
grumbled Barry, "when we weren't going to
punch and oysters? That's a better game."</p>

<p>If Mathieson had not been drinking, he might
have been touched by the sight of Nettie; so
very white and delicate her little face looked,
trembling and eager, within that border of her
black hood, on which the snow crystals lay, a
very doubtful and unwholesome embroidery. She
looked as if she was going to melt and disappear
like one of them; and perhaps Mr. Mathieson
did feel the effect of her presence, but he felt it
only to be vexed and irritated; and Barry's suggestion
fell into ready ground.</p>

<p>"I tell you, go home!" he said, roughly.
"What are you doing here? I tell you I'm <i>not</i>
coming home&mdash;I'm engaged to supper to-night,
and I'm not going to miss it for any fool's nonsense.
Go home!"</p>

<p>Nettie's lip trembled, but that was all the outward
show of the agitation within. She would
not have delayed to obey if her father had been
quite himself; but in his present condition she
thought perhaps the next word might undo the
last; she could not go without another trial.
She waited an instant, and again said softly and
pleadingly, "Father, I've been and got cinnamon
and sugar for you,&mdash;all ready."</p>

<p>"Cinnamon and sugar&mdash;" he cursed with a
great oath; and turning, gave Nettie a violent
push from him, which was half a blow. "Go
home!" he repeated&mdash;"go home and mind your
own business, and don't take it upon you to mind
mine."</p>

<p>Nettie reeled, staggered, and coming blindly
against one or two timbers that lay on the ground,
she fell heavily over them. Nobody saw her; but
that her father should have laid a rough hand on
her hurt her sorely; it hurt her bitterly. He had
never done so before; and the cause why he came
to do it now rather made it more sorrowful than
less so to Nettie's mind.</p>

<p>She could not help a few salt tears from falling;
and for a moment Nettie's faith trembled.
Feeling weak, and broken, and miserable, the
thought came coldly across her mind, <i>would</i> the
Lord not hear her, after all? It was but a moment
of faith-trembling, but it made her ill. There
was more to do that: the push and fall over the
timbers had jarred her more than she knew at the
moment. Nettie walked slowly back on her road
till she neared the shop of Madame Auguste, then
she felt herself growing very ill, and just reached
the Frenchwoman's door to faint away on her
steps.</p>

<p>She did not remain there two seconds. Madame
Auguste had seen her go by an hour before, and
now sat at her window looking out to amuse herself,
but with a special intent to see and waylay
that pale child on her repassing the house. She
saw the little black hood reappear, and started
to open the door, just in time to see Nettie fall
down at her threshold. As instantly, two willing
arms were put under her, and lifted up the child
and bore her into the house. Then Madame took
off her hood, touched her lips with brandy, and
her brow with Cologne water, and chafed her
hands. She had laid Nettie on the floor of the
inner room, and put a pillow under her head; the
strength which had brought her so far having
failed there, and proved unequal to lift her again
and put her on the bed. Nettie presently came
to, opened her eyes, and looked at her nurse.</p>

<p>"Why, my Nettie," said the little woman, "what
is this, my child? what is the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But I must go home!" said
Nettie, trying to raise herself. "Mother will want
me&mdash;she'll want me."</p>

<p>"You will lie still, like a good child," said her
friend, gently putting her back on her pillow;
"and I will find some person to carry you home&mdash;or
some person what will bring your mother
here. I will go see if I can find some one now.
You lie still, Nettie."</p>

<p>Nettie lay still, feeling weak after that exertion
of trying to raise herself. She was quite restored
now, and her first thoughts were of grief that she
had for a moment failed to trust fully the Lord's
promises. She fully trusted them now. Let
her father do what he would, let things look as
dark as they might, Nettie felt sure that "the
rewarder of them that diligently seek Him" had
a blessing in store for her. Bible words, sweet
and long loved and rested on, came to her mind,
and Nettie rested on them with perfect rest.
"For He hath not despised nor abhorred the
affliction of the afflicted; neither hath He hid
His face from him; but when he cried unto
Him, <i>He heard</i>." "Our heart shall rejoice in
Him, <i>because we have trusted in His holy name</i>."
Prayer for forgiveness, and a thanksgiving of
great peace, filled Nettie's heart all the while
the Frenchwoman was gone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Madame Auguste had been looking
into the street, and seeing nobody out in the wet
snow, she rushed back to Nettie. Nettie was
like herself now, only very pale.</p>

<p>"I must have cut my lip somehow," she said;
"there's blood on my handkerchief. How did I
come in here?"</p>

<p>"Blood!" said the Frenchwoman; "where did
you cut yourself, Nettie? Let me look!"</p>

<p>Which she did, with a face so anxious and
eager that Nettie smiled at her. Her own brow
was as quiet and placid as ever it was.</p>

<p>"How did I get in here, Mrs. August?"</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman, however, did not answer
her. Instead of which she went to her cupboard
and got a cup and spoon, and then from a little
saucepan on the stove dipped out some <i>riz-au-gras</i>
again.</p>

<p>"What did you have for dinner, Nettie? you
did not tell me."</p>

<p>"Not much&mdash;I wasn't hungry," said Nettie.
"Oh, I must get up and go home to mother."</p>

<p>"You shall eat something first," said her friend;
and she raised Nettie's head upon another pillow,
and began to feed her with the spoon. "It is
good for you. You must take it. Where is your
father? Don't talk, but tell me. I will do
everything right."</p>

<p>"He is at work on Mr. Jackson's new house."</p>

<p>"Is he there to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Madame Auguste gave her all the "broth" in
the cup, then bade her keep still, and went to the
shop window. It was time for the men to be
quitting work, she knew; she watched for the
carpenters to come,&mdash;if they were not gone by
already!&mdash;how should she know? Even as she
thought this, a sound of rude steps and men's
voices came from down the road; and the
Frenchwoman went to her door and opened it.
The men came along, a scattered group of four
or five.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Mat'ieson there?" she said. Madame
Auguste hardly knew him by sight. "Men, I say!
is Mr. Mat'ieson there?"</p>

<p>"George, that's you; you're wanted," said one
of the group, looking back; and a fine-looking
tall man paused at Madame's threshold.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Mat'ieson?" said the Frenchwoman.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. That's my name."</p>

<p>"Will you come in? I have something to speak
to you. Your little daughter Nettie is very ill."</p>

<p>"Ill!" exclaimed the man. "Nettie!&mdash;Where
is she?"</p>

<p>"She is here. Hush! you must not say nothing
to her, but she is very ill. She is come fainting
at my door, and I have got her in here; but she
wants to go home, and I think you had better
tell her she will not go home, but she will stay
here with me to-night."</p>

<p>"Where is she?" said Mr. Mathieson; and he
stepped in with so little ceremony that the mistress
of the house gave way before him. He
looked round the shop.</p>

<p>"She is not here&mdash;you shall see her&mdash;but you
must not tell her she is ill," said the Frenchwoman,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" repeated Mr. Mathieson, with
a tone and look which made Madame Auguste
afraid he would burst the doors if she did not
open them. She opened the inner door without
further preparation, and Mr. Mathieson walked
in. By the fading light he saw Nettie lying on
the floor at his feet. He was thoroughly himself
now; sobered in more ways than one. He stood
still when he had got there, and spoke not a
word.</p>

<p>"Father," said Nettie, softly.</p>

<p>He stooped down over her. "What do you
want, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Can't I go home?"</p>

<p>"She must better not go home to-night," began
Madame Auguste, earnestly, "it is so wet and
cold! She will stay here with me to-night, Mr.
Mat'ieson. You will tell her that it is best."</p>

<p>But Nettie said, "<i>Please</i> let me go home!
mother will be so troubled." She spoke little,
for she felt weak; but her father saw her very
eager in the request. He stooped and put his
strong arms under her, and lifted her up.</p>

<p>"Have you got anything to put over her?" he
said, looking round the room. "I'll fetch it back."</p>

<p>Seeing that the matter was quite taken out of
her hands, the kind little Frenchwoman was very
quick in her arrangements. She put on Nettie's
head a warm hood of her own; then round her
and over her she wrapped a thick woollen counterpane,
that to be sure would have let no snow
through if the distance to be travelled had been
twice as far. As she folded and arranged the
thick stuff round Nettie's head, so as to shield
even her face from the outer air, she said, half
whispering,</p>

<p>"I would not tell nothing to mother about your
lip; it is not much. I wish I could keep you.
Now she is ready, Mr. Mat'ieson."</p>

<p>And Mr. Mathieson stalked out of the house
and strode along the road with firm, swift steps,
till, past Jackson's, and past the turning, he came
to his own door, and carried Nettie upstairs. He
never said a word the whole way. Nettie was
too muffled up and too feeble to speak; so the
first word was when he had come in and sat down
in a chair, which he did with Nettie still in his
arms. Mrs. Mathieson, standing white and silent,
waited to see what was the matter; she had no
power to ask a question. Her husband unfolded
the counterpane that was wrapped round Nettie's
head; and there she was, looking very like her
usual self, only exceedingly pale. As soon as she
caught sight of her mother's face, Nettie would
have risen and stood up, but her father's arms
held her fast. "What do you want, Nettie?" he
asked. It was the first word.</p>

<p>"Nothing, father," said Nettie, "only lay me
on the bed, please; and then you and mother
have supper."</p>

<p>Mr. Mathieson took her to the bed and laid
her gently down, removing the wet counterpane
which was round her.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" faltered Mrs. Mathieson.</p>

<p>"Nothing much, mother," said Nettie, quietly;
"only I was a little ill. Won't you bake the
waffles and have supper?"</p>

<p>"What will <i>you</i> have?" said her father.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;I've had something. I feel nicely
now," said Nettie. "Mother, won't you have
supper, and let me see you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson's strength had well-nigh deserted
her; but Nettie's desire was urgent, and
seeing that her husband had seated himself by
the bed-side, and seemed to have no idea of being
anywhere but at home that evening, she at length
gathered up her faculties to do what was the best
thing to be done, and went about preparing the
supper. Nettie's eyes watched her, and Mr. Mathieson,
when he thought himself safe, watched
<i>her</i>. He did not look like the same man, so
changed and sobered was the expression of his
face. Mrs. Mathieson was devoured by fear, even
in observing this; but Nettie was exceedingly
happy. She did not feel anything but weakness;
and she lay on her pillow watching the waffles
baked and sugared, and then watching them
eaten, wondering and rejoicing within herself at
the way in which her father had been brought to
eat his supper there at home after all. She was
the only one that enjoyed anything, though her
father and mother ate to please her. Mrs. Mathieson
had asked an account of Nettie's illness,
and got a very unsatisfactory one. She had been
faint, her husband said; he had found her at Mrs.
Auguste's, and brought her home; that was about
all.</p>

<p>After supper he came and sat by Nettie again,
and said she was to sleep there, and he would go
up and take Nettie's place in the attic. Nettie
in vain said she was well enough to go upstairs;
her father cut the question short, and bade Mrs.
Mathieson go up and get anything Nettie wanted.
When she had left the room he stooped his head
down to Nettie and said low,</p>

<p>"What was that about your lip?"</p>

<p>Nettie started: she thought he would fancy it
had it been done, if done at all, when he gave
her the push at the frame-house. But she did not,
dare not, answer. She said it was only that she
had found a little blood on her handkerchief,
and supposed she might have cut her lip when she
fell on Mrs. Auguste's threshold, when she had
fainted.</p>

<p>"Show me your handkerchief," said her father.
Nettie obeyed. He looked at it, and looked close
at her lips, to find where they might have been
wounded; and Nettie was sorry to see how much
he felt, for he even looked pale himself as he
turned away from her. But he was as gentle and
kind as he could be! Nettie had never seen him
so; and when he went off up to bed, and Nettie
was drawn into her mother's arms to go to sleep,
she was very, very happy. But she did not tell
her hopes or her joys to her mother; she only
told her thanks to the Lord; and that she did
till she fell asleep.</p>

<p>The next morning Nettie was well enough to
get up and dress herself. That was all she was
suffered to do by father or mother. Mr. Mathieson
sent Barry for water and wood, and himself
looked after the fire while Mrs. Mathieson was
busy; all the rest he did was to take Nettie in
his arms and sit holding her till breakfast was
ready. He did not talk, and he kept Barry quiet:
he was like a different man. Nettie, feeling indeed
very weak, could only sit with her head on
her father's shoulder, and wonder, and think, and
repeat quiet prayers in her heart. She was very
pale yet, and it distressed Mr. Mathieson to see
that she could not eat. So he laid her on the
bed when he was going to his work, and told her
she was to stay there and be still, and he would
bring her something good when he came home.</p>

<p>He was as good as his word, and at night
brought home some oysters, to tempt Nettie's
appetite; but it was much more to her that he
stayed quietly at home, and never made a move
towards going out. Eating was not in Nettie's
line just now; the kind little Frenchwoman had
been to see her in the course of the day, and
brought some delicious rolls and a jug of <i>riz-au-gras</i>,
which was what seemed to suit Nettie's
appetite best of all.</p>

</div><div class="noindent">everal days went on. She did not feel
ill, and she was a little stronger; but
appetite and colour were wanting. Her
father would not let her do anything; he would
not let her go up to her garret to sleep, though
Nettie pleaded for it, fearing he must be uncomfortable.
He said it was fitter for him than for
her, though he made faces about it. He always
came home and stayed at home now, and especially
attended to Nettie; his wages came home
too, and he brought every day something to try
to tempt her to eat; and he was quiet and grave
and kind&mdash;not the same person.</div>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson, in the midst of all her distress
about Nettie, began to draw some free breaths.
But her husband thought only of his child&mdash;unless,
perhaps, of himself&mdash;and drew none. Regularly
after supper he would draw Nettie to his
arms, and sit with her head upon his shoulder;
silent generally, only he would sometimes ask her
what she would like. The first time he put this
inquiry when Mr. Lumber was out of the way,
Nettie answered by asking him to read to her.
Mr. Mathieson hesitated a little, not unkindly,
and then read&mdash;a chapter in the Bible, of course,
for Nettie wished to hear nothing else. And after
that he often read to her; for Mr. Lumber kept
up his old habits and preferred livelier company,
and so was always out in the evenings.</p>

<p>So several days passed; and when Saturday
came, Mr. Mathieson lost half a day's work, and
took a long walk to a farm where the people kept
pigeons, and brought home one for Nettie's supper.
However, she could fancy but little of it.</p>

<p>"What shall I do for you?" said her father.
"You go round like a shadow, and you don't eat
much more. What shall I do that you would
like?"</p>

<p>This time there was nobody in the room.
Nettie lifted her head from his shoulders and
met his eyes,</p>

<p>"If you would come to Jesus, father!"</p>

<p>"What does that mean, Nettie? You know
I don't know."</p>

<p>"It means, father, that Jesus is holding out His
hand with a promise to you. Now, if you will
take the promise,&mdash;that is all."</p>

<p>"What is the promise, Nettie?"</p>

<p>Nettie waited, gathered breath, for the talk
made her heart beat, and then said, "'This is the
promise that He hath promised us, even eternal
life.'"</p>

<p>"How can a sinful man take such a promise?"
said Mr. Mathieson, with suppressed feeling.
"That is for people like you, Nettie, not me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jesus, has bought it!" cried Nettie; "it's
free. It's without price. You may have it if
you'll believe in Him and love Him, father.&mdash;I
can't talk."</p>

<p>She had talked too much, or the excitement
had been too strong for her. Her words were
broken off by coughing, and she remarked that
her lip must have bled again. Her father laid
her on the bed, and from that time for a number
of days she was kept as quiet as possible; for
her strength had failed anew, and yet more than
at first.</p>

<p>For two weeks she hardly moved from the bed.
But except that she was so very pale, she did
not look very ill; her face wore just its own
patient and happy expression. Her father would
not now let her talk to him; but he did everything
she asked. He read to her in the Bible;
Nettie would turn over the leaves to the place
she wanted, and then point it out to him with a
look of life, and love, and pleasure, that were
like a whole sermon; and her father read first
that sermon and then the chapter. He went to
church as she asked him; and without her asking
him, after the first Sunday. Nettie stayed
at home on the bed, and sang psalms in her
heart.</p>

<p>After those two weeks there was a change for
the better. Nettie felt stronger, looked more as
she used to look, and got up and even went about
a little. The weather was changing too, now.
April days were growing soft and green; trees
budding and grass freshening up, and birds all
alive in the branches; and above all, the air and
the light, the wonderful soft breath of spring, and
sunshine of spring, made people forget that winter
had ever been harsh or severe.</p>

<p>Nettie went out and took little walks in the
sun which seemed to do her good; and she begged
so hard to be allowed to go to her garret again,
that her father took pity on her, sent Mr. Lumber
away, and gave her her old nice little room on
the same floor with the others. Her mother
cleaned it and put it in order, and Nettie felt
too happy when she found herself mistress of it
again, and possessed of a quiet place where she
could read and pray alone. With windows open,
how sweetly the spring walked in there, and
made it warm, and bright, and fragrant too!</p>

<p>Nettie wished she could sing, for she had often
seen singing comfort her mother; but she had not
the power to-day. She gave her the best she
could. Her words, however, constantly carried
hurt and healing together to her mother's mind.
But when Nettie went on to repeat softly the
verse of a hymn that follows, she was soothed,
notwithstanding the hinted meaning in the words.
So sweet was the trust of the hymn, so unruffled
the trust of the speaker. The words were from
a little bit of a book of translations of German
hymns which Mr. Folke, her Sunday-school
teacher, had brought her, and which was never
out of Nettie's hand.</p>

</div>

<p>Slowly she said the words, with her usual
sober, placid face; and Mrs. Mathieson was
mute.</p>

<p>For some weeks, as the spring breathed warmer
and warmer, Nettie revived; so much that her
mother at times felt encouraged about her. Mr.
Mathieson was never deceived. Whether his
former neglect of his child had given him particular
keenness of vision in all that concerned
her now, or for whatever reason, <i>he</i> saw well
enough, and saw constantly, that Nettie was
going to leave him. There was never a wish of
hers uncared for now; there was not a straw suffered
to lie in her path, that he could take out of
it. He went to church, and he read at home;
he changed his behaviour to her mother as well
as to herself, and he brought Barry to his bearings.
What more did Nettie want?</p>

<p>One Sunday, late in May, her father came into
her room to see her. He kissed her, and said a
few words, and then went to the window and
stood there looking out. Both were silent for
some time, while the birds sang on.</p>

<p>"Father," said Nettie.</p>

<p>He turned instantly, and asked her what she
wanted.</p>

<p>"Father," said Nettie, "the streets of the
heavenly city are all of gold."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, meeting her grave eyes, "and
what then, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Only I was thinking, if the <i>streets</i> are gold,
how clean must the feet be that walk on them!"</p>

<p>He knew what her intent eyes meant, and
he sat down by her bed-side and laid his face
in his hands. "I am a sinful man, Nettie!" he
said.</p>

<p>"Father, 'this is a faithful saying, that Jesus
Christ came into the world to save sinners.'"</p>

<p>"I don't deserve He should save me, Nettie."</p>

<p>"Well, father, ask Him to save you, <i>because</i> you
don't deserve it."</p>

<p>"What sort of a prayer would that be?"</p>

<p>"The right one, father; for Jesus does deserve
it, and for His sake is the only way. If you deserved
it, you wouldn't want Jesus; but now '<i>He</i>
is our peace.' Oh, father, listen, listen to what
the Bible says." She had been turning the
leaves of her Bible, and read low and earnestly,
"'Now we are ambassadors for God, as though
God did beseech you by us; we pray you, in
Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.' Oh,
father, aren't you willing to be reconciled to
Him?"</p>

<p>"God knows I am willing!" said Mr. Mathieson.</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> is willing, I am sure," said Nettie.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Mr. Mathieson
never stirred. Nor Nettie hardly. The words
were true of her,&mdash;"He that believeth shall not
make haste." She waited, looking at him. Then
he said, "What must I do, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>"How, child?"</p>

<p>"Father, the best way is to ask Him, and He
will tell you how. If you are only willing to be
His servant, if you are willing to give yourself
to the Lord Jesus&mdash;are you willing, father?"</p>

<p>"I am willing&mdash;anything!&mdash;if He will have
me," said Mr. Mathieson.</p>

<p>"Then go, father!" said Nettie, eagerly, "go
and ask Him, and He will teach you how; He
will! He has promised. Go, father, and ask the
Lord&mdash;will you? Go now."</p>

<p>Her father remained still a moment&mdash;then he
rose up and went out of the room, and she heard
his steps going up to the unused attic. Nettie
crossed her hands upon her breast, and smiled.
She was too much exhausted to pray otherwise
than with a thought.</p>

<p>Then slumber stole over her, and she slept
sweetly and quietly while the hours of the summer
afternoon rolled away. Her mother watched beside
her for a long while before she awoke, and
during that time read surely in Nettie's delicate
cheek and too delicate colour what was the sentence
of separation. She read it, and smothered
the cry of her heart, for Nettie's sake.</p>

<p>The sun was descending toward the western
hill country, and long level rays of light were
playing in the tree-tops, when Nettie awoke.</p>

<p>"Are you there, mother?" she said&mdash;"and is
the Sunday so near over? How I have slept!"</p>

<p>"How do you feel, dear?"</p>

<p>"Why, I feel well," said Nettie. "It has been
a good day. The gold is all in the air here&mdash;not
in the streets." She had half raised herself, and
was sitting looking out of the window.</p>

<p>"Do you think of that city all the time?" inquired
Mrs. Mathieson, half jealously.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Nettie, slowly, still looking out
at the sunlight, "would you be very sorry, and
very much surprised, if I were to go there before
long?"</p>

<p>"I should not be very much surprised, Nettie,"
answered her mother, in a tone that told all the
rest. Her child's eye turned to her sorrowfully
and understandingly.</p>

<p>"You'll not be very long before you'll be there
too," she said. "Now kiss me, mother."</p>

<p>Could Mrs. Mathieson help it? She took
Nettie in her arms, but instead of the required
kiss, there came a burst of passion that bowed her
head in convulsive grief against her child's breast.</p>

<p>Ashamed of her giving way, Mrs. Mathieson
checked herself and dried her tears. Nettie lay
down wearily.</p>

<p>"I will stay here, mother," she said, "till tea is
ready; and then I will come."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson went to attend to it.</p>

<p>When Nettie went into the other room, her
father was sitting there. She said nothing, however,
and even for some time did not look in his
face to see what he might have to say to her.
She took a cup of tea and a biscuit, and ate an
egg that her mother had boiled for her. It was
when supper was over, and they had moved from
the table, and Mrs. Mathieson was busy about,
that Nettie turned her eyes once more upon her
father, with their soft, full inquiry. He looked
grave, subdued, tender&mdash;she had heard that in
his voice already; not as she had ever seen him
look before. He met her eyes and answered them.</p>

<p>"I understand it now, Nettie," he said; then
drew her close within his arms; and without one
word Nettie sat there, till for very happiness and
weariness she fell asleep, and he carried her to
her room.</p>

<p>There was a great calm fell upon the family
for a little time thereafter. It was like one of
those spring days that were past&mdash;full of misty
light, and peace, and hope, and promise. It was
a breath of rest.</p>

<p>But they knew it would end&mdash;for a time; and
one summer day the end came. It was a Sunday
again, and again Nettie was lying on her bed,
enjoying in her weakness the loveliness of the
air and beauty without. Her mother was with
her, and knew that she had been failing very fast
for some days. Nettie knew it too.</p>

<p>"How soon do you think father will be home?"
she said.</p>

<p>"Not before another hour, I think," said Mrs.
Mathieson. "Why, what of it, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Nothing<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>" said Nettie, doubtfully. "I'd
like him to come."</p>

<p>"It won't be long," said her mother.</p>

<p>"Mother, I am going to give you my little
dear hymn-book," said Nettie presently; "and I
want to read you a hymn now, and then you will
think of me when you read it. May I?"</p>

<p>"Read," said Mrs. Mathieson; and she put up
her hand to hide her face from Nettie. Nettie
did not look, however; her eyes were on her
hymn, and she read it, low and sweetly&mdash;very
sweetly&mdash;through. There was no tremor in her
voice, but now and then a little accent of joy or
a shade of tenderness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson's head bowed as the hymn
went on, but she dared not give way to tears, and
Nettie's manner half awed and half charmed her
into quietness. When the reading ceased, and
Mrs. Mathieson felt that she could look toward
Nettie again, she saw that the book had fallen
from her hand, and that she was almost fainting.
Alarmed, instantly she called for help, and got
one of the inmates of the house to go after
Mr. Mathieson. But Nettie sank so fast, they
were afraid he would not come in time. The
messenger came back without having been able
to find him; for after the close of the services in
the church Mr. Mathieson had gone out of his
way on an errand of kindness. Nettie herself
was too low to ask for him, if indeed she was
conscious he was not there. They could not
tell; she lay without taking any notice.</p>

<p>But just as the last rays of the sun were bright
in the leaves of the trees and on the hills in the
distance, Mr. Mathieson's step was heard. One
of the neighbours met him and told him what he
must expect; and he came straight to Nettie's
room. And when he bent down over her and
spoke, Nettie knew his voice, and opened her
eyes, and once more smiled. It was like a smile
from another country. Her eyes were fixed on
him. Mr. Mathieson bent yet nearer and put his
lips to hers; then he tried to speak.</p>

<p>"My little peacemaker, what shall I do without
you?"</p>

<p>Nettie drew a long, long breath. "Peace&mdash;is&mdash;made!"
she slowly said.</p>

<p>And the peacemaker was gone.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
